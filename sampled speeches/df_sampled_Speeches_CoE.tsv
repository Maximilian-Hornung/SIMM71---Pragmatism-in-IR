This awareness underpinned the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the establishment of the Council of Europe itself. We are pleased that you are here with us today, President Zourabichvili, in recognition of the importance that the Georgian Presidency – and you personally – attach to this event. Because, as the years pass by, and the survivors grow fewer in number, it becomes ever more important to remember the terrible atrocities carried out on European soil. Around six million Jews were brutally murdered during the years of the Second World War. But Roma, LGBTI people and others were imprisoned, tortured and killed too. To each of these, we pay our deepest respects today, mindful of the generations that have been lost – and of the contributions that those people would have made to European life. We also remember because it is our duty to ensure that such things can happen never again: That we do everything possible to prevent and to counter the hatred and prejudice that breeds violence and discrimination.

These thirty cartoons deploy skill, wit and imagination to represent what human rights mean and the complexities and impediments that too often prevent them from being realised. I congratulate our Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovic, the French Presidency of our Committee of Ministers and the artists and organisers themselves for their respective roles in ensuring this display. It constitutes an important part of the autumn initiative by Cartooning for Peace to turn Strasbourg, the capital of Europe, into Strasbourg, the capital of cartoons. And I am very happy this will include a Carte Blanche session at our World Forum for Democracy on the afternoon of 7th November, where press cartoonists will discuss and draw. This will be followed the next morning by a plenary session on the Freedom of Expression and Protection of Journalists - with Plantu himself as a speaker. And throughout the course of the three-day Forum, the cartoonists will collaborate on the production of a multi-panelled fresco, and illustrate each of the plenaries with live drawings. But in the meantime, I again congratulate everyone involved in this imaginative and important exhibition and I encourage you to take a close look at all of the works on display. I am confident that they will spark the creativity within each of us too.

Given the relevance of the topic, both the Georgian Presidency of the Committee of Ministers and I wanted to ensure that this discussion could still take place, albeit in a different format. After all, the COVID pandemic exemplifies only too well that for a democracy to thrive, those who take the decisions must have the trust of those they represent. But in many parts of Europe today, trust in democracy and democratic institutions has declined. This manifests in a number of different ways: For example, falling turnout for elections: Increasing support for populism, authoritarianism and nationalism: And a marked shift away from traditional means of participation towards more direct expressions of frustration including protests, boycotts and petitions, and social media campaigns online. We know that this fall in the level of traditional democratic participation and representation can sometimes involve specific groups disproportionately, including women, young people and minorities. We know that its causes can vary by degree, from country to country and depending on circumstances. But we also know that there is a problem when there is a real or perceived disconnect between citizens’ expectations and the decisions taken by policy makers on their behalf – And that, by contrast, citizens express both trust and satisfaction where political institutions are held to high standards and are seen to meet them. The Council of Europe has a mandate to protect and promote democracy within our member states, and to establish the common standards that help achieve this. But this cannot succeed as a top-down process. Rather, it requires buy-in from the bottom up: From domestic political leadership, certainly – but with the active involvement and participation of citizens too. Because if we succeed in bringing decision-making closer to the people, it will become more responsive, and if it becomes more responsive, it will garner more trust. The Council of Europe has long understood the value of a strong civil society in our member states and has sought to help them achieve this at every level of government. In 2008, our 12 Principles of Good Democratic Governance set out a blueprint for local institutions to deliver high standards, with the requirement of participation front and centre. And complementary new Guidelines setting-out the principles of public ethics and standards of conduct for public officials are currently being prepared. In addition, we have adopted a range of instruments that aim to strengthen civil engagement. These include Guidelines for civil participation in political decision-making; A Recommendation to member states on the participation of citizens in local public life; And, in October of last year, a Revised Code of Good Practice for Civil Participation in the Decision-making Process, adopted by our Conference of International Non-governmental Organisations.

I thank you, Foreign Minister, for inviting me to speak – And I also thank officials in her ministry, the National Women’s Institute and UN Women for their organisation of this event. As is so often the case, when women collaborate, good things happen. The fact that such a diverse range of countries – From around the world – Have sent such high-level representatives – And that the last three days has provided such space for sharing ideas, experiences and best practice – All of this can only pave the way to further steps forward on feminist foreign policies. Like so many of you – I believe that these are essential to ensuring that the UN Summit for the Future, its Pact for the Future and the UN Sustainable Goals – Are not only aspirational events and words – But become landmark achievements – And that they do so as quickly as possible. As a European, I am proud that many of the countries that have adopted such policies in recent years are from my continent – But I am far from satisfied. Because other European states have not – And there are also signs that some have gone backwards. I have no doubt that this is linked to the recent rise of anti-rights movements – Part of a wider trend of democratic backsliding – Which is itself fuelled by the resurgence of extreme populism and nationalism in parts of Europe – And the wider world. Last year, my Organisation, the Council of Europe, held a Summit of the Heads of State and Government of our 46 member states. This took place in Reykjavík, Iceland – And was the largest ever gathering of our European leaders. There, they committed to stopping and reversing this democratic backsliding – Including through the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights – Which has the force of law in every one of our member states – And through the execution of the final judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, which interprets it. The Convention and the Court have done a great deal over the years to clarify women’s rights in law – And to ensure that governments respect them. This is an international, multilateral approach – That elevates the rights of individuals – of women – above the tides of politics. But it is important to say the Council of Europe has also worked with our members states over many years to advance women’s rights and interests – Through various legal and soft-law initiatives. This approach has evolved in line with the evolving challenges of our times. Today, our Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence is central to our effort. This treaty aims to prevent violence, protect its victims and help prosecute the perpetrators. In force for 10 years now, the Istanbul Treaty recognises that violence scars, intimidates and inhibits its victims – Undermining their freedom, security and potential. Until this is stopped – And it must be stopped – True gender equality cannot be achieved. But why are we so sure that the Istanbul Convention is a central part of the answer? Because, over the course of a decade, we have seen its impact with our own eyes. In every country that has ratified this treaty, laws have been changed. Offences have been defined, including rape, stalking, forced marriage, sexual harassment, and female genital mutilation – And national policies and national action plans have been put in place – Supported by our monitoring bodies – Which are doing so much good for so many women in so many communities. Despite the mis-interpretations – and misrepresentations – Often underpinned by misogyny, and the anti-women, anti-rights movements that cause so much harm. The Istanbul Convention’s circle of membership continues to grow. 38 countries have now ratified the treaty. So has the European Union. And others – including from outside Europe – are preparing to do so. The UN has described the Istanbul Treaty as the “gold standard” in its field. We are determined to share that standard ever more widely. There is still more to do, of course. In fact, our new Gender Equality Strategy is taking on that challenge. Launched this year, the Strategy is uniquely tailored to fit the times we live in. Our societies are fast-changing – And our action for equality must keep pace. The rise of digital technology has brought new forms of violence with it – Of which most victims are women and girls – As you have discussed. Online trolling and cyberstalking, sexist abuse and hate speech, sextortion, non-consensual sharing of intimate images, deepfakes, doxing, hacking and rape threats – The list is long, and seems ever-growing – And so too are the number of offences. One recent survey suggested that 58% of girls and young women have faced some form of online harassment. Other groups of women are also at higher risk. Women in public life, for example – Including lawmakers, human rights defenders, and journalists. This kind of violence also remains largely unreported and unpunished – An impunity that can only encourage more offending. So, we need effective means to tackle these forms of violence – And to ensure equal access to justice too. That is why our new Gender Equality Strategy – Alongside the Istanbul Convention, and a new recommendation to member states – Will form a trinity of measures to provide greater protection and justice. But the new Strategy is not limited to issues of violence. These include combating sexism and gender stereotyping. On this, the implementation of our 2019 recommendation to our member states’ governments has already led to positive change. New laws, better data collection, and awareness-raising campaigns have achieved a lot at national level. But we need to go further – Especially in light of new dimensions to the issue – Including the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. AI systems’ datasets and sources often lock in gender bias – And then replicate it – Assuming that women fill domestic or family roles, for example – While associating men with business, leadership and money. On top of that, AI-related industries are tilted towards men. Women represent just 18% of authors at AI conferences – 12% of AI researchers – And 6% of professional software developers. As in other fields, AI needs a more diverse, gender-equal workforce – To ensure balance, inclusion of interests and proper representation. Taken together, the new Gender Equality Strategy and our new Framework Convention on AI will seek to ensure this. The Strategy will also look more broadly at achieving balanced participation of women and men in political and public life. In most European countries, women’s representation in legislative, executive and judicial bodies remains stubbornly below the Council of Europe’s agreed minimum of 40%. In Europe’s parliaments, for example, less than a third of members are women. To address this, parity initiatives and gender quotas are important – But we also need a mix of measures to change the culture and make participation easier and more attractive. Efforts to stop sexism and discrimination of all kinds – To create a welcoming environment – And to promote work-life balance. These are important to achieving fair participation in economic and social life more generally – As are access to the labour market – Equal pay, for which we have long campaigned, and at least narrowed the gap – And the sharing of caring and domestic work. We need further progress on all of this – Just as we need the Strategy to expand the reach of gender mainstreaming – So that the importance of equality is baked into policy and decision-making processes. On this, we have a new online course for the legal and policy professionals – And a new intersectional approach that considers specific needs and vulnerabilities. This year’s recommendation to member states on equality for Roma and Traveller Women and Girls is a positive example of what this approach looks like in practice. Other priorities include further work to help men and boys understand their role in making gender equality a reality – And why this is in their interests too – And women’s empowerment in relation to global and geopolitical challenges – Paying particular attention to key issues such as the impact of climate change on gender equality – And the need to build on our 2022 recommendation on protecting the rights of migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking women and girls. Looking back, all of the progress that the Council of Europe has made on gender equality has come from working not just with national authorities – Vital though that is – But also from harnessing the ideas, insights and determination of activists, civil society organisations, and the private sector. But the progress that we have made is uneven and incomplete. And the social and technological development of twenty-first century Europe means that both the challenges themselves – And our understanding of how to meet them – Are developing fast. Only by working together can we hope to make gender equality the reality that we long for – In the interests of all Europeans, and of people around the world. So, this event is not only a space for sharing perspectives – But also for building alliances – Wide and strong – So that feminist foreign policies win the battle of ideas – Are adopted – And make our world a better, more equal and more inclusive place – In which every individual can live and thrive in dignity.

This is one of the first events in which outside experts have been able to join us physically since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. But whether you are here in the room or joining us online, your participation is of course greatly appreciated. I also want to extend a special welcome to you, Commissioner Dalli. You are the first ever EU Commissioner on Equality and the creation of that post, and your personal commitment to it, are testament to the desire to create a better Europe – one that is free from discrimination and inequality. In this task, the EU and the Council of Europe are partners that will work together to bring about change. So, today is an opportunity to take stock of the challenges that exist on our continent and to reflect on what should be done. On a positive note, general awareness of the problems facing Europe’s minorities is greater than it has ever been, and many countries have taken specific steps to address these. But, equally, there can be no doubt about the prejudice and ill-treatment that still face migrants, LGBTI people, and ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, including of course Roma and Travellers. From hate speech online or in person, through to inequalities in health, housing and education, there are significant problems, sometimes worsening, and clearly visible to those who are willing to see. In some cases, the COVID-19 pandemic has shone new light on these difficulties and, in others, it may even have worsened them. Now is the moment for an intergovernmental, expert-driven structure that will look at these issues, supplementing the work of our monitoring bodies. So, the creation of the CDADI is timely and its importance to the Council of Europe is clear. In line with the evolution of our thinking, it will take an intersectional and holistic approach to supporting anti-discrimination and equality. And it will promote and facilitate thematic exchanges and peer reviews of good practice among Council of Europe member states. That way, we can increase awareness of Council of Europe standards and recommendations, better develop common policy responses, and analyse and improve their implementation. This change is a marker of our determination to think big, with the CDADI as a powerhouse of new ideas that will address the scale and persistence of the inequalities we witness today. Already, the Committee has been tasked with several major initiatives.

The Digital Dimension of Freedom is a priority of the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers – So, there is no better place to hold this event – Or to explain the cutting-edge role that the Council of Europe is playing when it comes to public policy on internet governance. Our Organisation has always understood the importance of balancing innovation and regulation when it comes to new technologies. But, in fact, it would be wrong to see these things as weighing against one another. Rather, they should move in tandem – Ensuring that technology develops in a way that truly benefits our societies. This has been our approach with previous
tech-related legal treaties. Our Budapest Convention on Cybercrime – Which remains the international gold standard in its field – Harmonising national laws, improving investigations and increasing cross-border
co-operation – To tackle internet and computer-based crimes – And our Convention 108 – Which has ensured people’s privacy and data protection for over four decades now. Both of these are open conventions – Allowing countries from outside Europe to ratify them – And I know that our team taking part in this year’s EuroDIG has explained how the recent “upgrades” to these treaties have ensured that they keep pace with ever-evolving technology – As well as outlining our pioneering work on addressing the human rights challenges brought by the Metaverse – And sharing our guidance on how to counter disinformation on the internet. This is a subject of particular importance in a “bumper” election year – In which more than four billion people have the opportunity to vote worldwide – And where they should be able to cast their ballots based on accurate information. There is however a specific and positive development about which I also want to speak today. Last month, at our Ministerial Session in Strasbourg, the Council of Europe’s foreign ministers adopted our new Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence – And human rights, democracy and the rule of law. This is the first international legally binding treaty in this area. It is designed specifically to allow AI technology to flourish – But to do so in a way that protect individuals’ rights and does not undermine them. This means that AI systems should uphold the highest standards throughout their lifecycles – Applying principles that are technology neutral and therefore future-proof – So that gaps created by rapid technological advances are closed - and remain closed. These principles include human dignity and individual autonomy – Equality and non-discrimination – Protection of privacy and personal data – Accountability and responsibility – Protection, transparency and oversight – And safe innovation and reliability. On top of this, the Framework Convention also sets out governments’ obligations to provide accessible procedural safeguards and remedies – To help prevent AI systems from “going off the rails” – both in the private and the public sectors – And thereby breaching our common standards – And also to ensure justice where this does happen. This treaty has the potential to ensure safer, more secure Artificial Intelligence – Not just in Europe, but around the world. Because the Framework Convention – Just like the Budapest Convention and Convention 108 + – Is an open convention – With the potential to help converge AI regulation throughout not just our continent – But among countries around the world that share our values – And that want to be part of this process. Many of them are already well-versed in the content. Because our Committee on Artificial Intelligence – Which did such good work in bringing this text together – Had the input, not only of our 46 member states – But also the insights of a diverse group of 11 Observer States from around the world, plus the EU. Our inclusive process has produced a strong text that also drew from the ideas and expertise of 68 non-state actors – Respected academics – Private businesses – And civil society organisations. This even handed, big-tent – multi-stakeholder –approach has delivered. Now, we move to the next stage. The Framework Convention will be opened for signature on 5 September, here in Vilnius – And I hope that many countries will move swiftly to sign it, ratify it, and bring it into force – So that as many citizens as possible gain from what it has to offer. But we are also aware that a transversal treaty like the Framework Convention alone is not enough. We need to ensure a comprehensive approach – With binding and non-binding instruments that address sector-specific challenges – So that our common standards apply there too. We know, for example, that AI can include – And even amplify – Bias in its systems. So, we will undertake further, urgent work on how to prevent these systems from entrenching structural discrimination, marginalisation and inequality. More than this, we should look for ways to ensure that AI should not merely avoid bias – But actively and positively promote equality instead. So, alongside the Framework Convention, we will develop new sectoral instruments – Designed to do just that. We will shape tools to evaluate the implementation of the new Convention. This will also be prepared by our Committee on Artificial Intelligence – By the end of next year. Ladies and gentlemen, We know that artificial Intelligence has the power to transform our societies. But while people often talk about this in terms of its impact on our personal and professional lives – It is equally true of our rights. At its best, innovation in AI can promote equality and uphold our standards of human rights, democracy and the rule of law when these are challenged. The Council of Europe is determined to work with experts and others to ensure that this happens – So that AI innovates in the best possible way. Our new Framework Convention and future work plan reflect our determination to deliver on this from all angles – Including internet governance. The future of technology remains ours to determine.

For example, our Steering Committee for Human Rights is looking at the potential for a new recommendation on human rights and the environment. The European Committee on Crime Problems is considering how our Convention on the Protection of the Environment though Criminal Law could be updated to provide clearer legal obligations – and stronger sanctions – when it comes to combatting environmental crimes. And following ratification by Ukraine this summer, our Tromsø Convention on Access to Official Documents will enter into force on the first of December, guaranteeing public scrutiny of decision-making on environmental issues. Additionally – and across the Organisation – there is a range of awareness-raising and co-operation activities. A new online HELP module will soon be made available to legal professionals, enabling them to better understand and apply the law in this area. Our next World Forum for Democracy will bring together key politicians, experts and activists to debate whether democracy can save the environment. And the Council of Europe Bank has prioritised the transition to more green and sustainable economies and lent its members hundreds of millions of euros to invest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency and supporting adaptation strategies that build climate change resilience. I also want to pay tribute to the work that is being done by the Parliamentary Assembly, which is preparing reports that will look at a range of the central issues. All of those panels will address complex legal questions that will be pivotal to the progress we go on to make. We need clarity on the scope, process and capacity of this Court – and our Organisation – to ensure that the quality of the environment enables Europeans to benefit from the human rights, democracy and rule of law standards to which they are entitled. And I have no doubt about the capacity of this Conference to contribute to that end. I wish you all every success.

Both are committed to European standards in human rights – And to removing the barriers that prevent people from benefitting from them. This perspective underpins our excellent co-operation. At a time when extreme nationalism and populism – Anti-rights movements – And new challenges to the way we live, all threaten the enjoyment of those rights – Our determination and close working relationship remain vital. Together, we can better ensure that social, economic and technological changes in our societies take our human rights forward. This is my understanding of what we mean when we speak about “rights in motion”. The themes addressed at this Forum are pressing and urgent – And on each, the Council of Europe is hard at work. Human rights and democracy go hand-in-hand – And we recognise the need to move from “erosion to empowerment”. Democratic backsliding can be found throughout Europe today. One of its forms is the use and misuse of laws to limit legitimate protest and shrink civic space. This is utterly wrong. It runs contrary to the right to freedom of assembly and association – Enshrined in Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights – Which has the force of law in our member states – Including the EU 27. When European leaders met last year for our Reykjavík Summit, they reinforced this point – Adopting 10 Reykjavík Principles of Democracy – In which they “commit to supporting and maintaining a safe and enabling environment where – “Civil society…can operate free from hindrance, insecurity and violence” – This recognises that a flourishing civil society is necessary for a healthy democracy. And now we are supporting our member states as they work to turn the tide on restricting it – And all other forms – Of democratic backsliding. You are also right to address the need to create a socially and environmentally sustainable Europe. The social rights laid out in the European Social Charter are of vital importance here. When governments ensure that these rights are a reality, this provides equality, solidarity and dignity – And our approach to supporting this will be further considered at a high-level conference in Vilnius, this July. On the environment too, there are big milestones ahead. For many years, we have been active in this area. But we recognise that the triple planetary crisis of pollution, climate change and the loss of biodiversity poses an ever-greater threat to human rights – And we are now at work on new instruments in this field. The same is true for ensuring rights-compliant digitalisation. Again, we have a range of groundbreaking treaties. Our Data Protection Convention – Convention 108 – And its upgraded version, 108+ – Our Cybercrime Convention and its Additional Protocols – Which extend the hand of justice further into cyberspace – And our range of tools on Artificial Intelligence – Which will soon include our new Convention on AI and human rights, democracy and the rule of law – The negotiations are at a crucial moment – this week. And I call on all member and non-member states participating in the negotiations – As well as on the European Union, to do their utmost to reach an agreement during the CAI meeting this week in Strasbourg – So that the Convention can be finalised in time for our Ministerial Session on 17 May – Made in Europe, this will be an open convention, that can be signed and ratified by countries around the world – So that we can all harness the benefits of AI – While upholding our rights, rather than undermining them. This work – all of it – was endorsed by European leaders in the Reykjavík Declaration issued at our Summit last year. They made clear their determination that our rights should apply to the world as it is today – And we are now deep into the delivery phase. Part of this must also be the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights – To help complete our continent’s human rights architecture. I am happy that good progress has been made on this – And hope that the EU will soon be able to complete the last outstanding steps that remain – So that the package of instruments that we have agreed can be adopted. Because it is in all our interests to work in harmony, as we seek the same ends. This Forum is an opportunity to explore new ways in which this should be done. And I wish you every success.

I have been asked to speak today about the future of Europe. In truth, that future is undetermined. The range of recent and ongoing challenges facing governments and citizens is lengthy, complicated and serious. They have included a financial crash – A global pandemic – And now the return to armed aggression on a scale that we have not seen since 1945. These have been set against the backdrop of increased and extreme populism and nationalism that have emerged in parts of our continent – And which often feed off the major problems facing our societies and the perceived inability to resolve them. The disruption to trade and supply caused by COVID-19 – And the limits placed on access to both food and fuel as a consequence of Russia’s actions – Are now pushing up inflation, dragging down wages, and threatening people’s standards of living. What these factors have in common is that they are cross-border in nature. They cannot be solved by governments working in isolation. But need action at the international level too, by means of multilateral cooperation. Europe’s political architecture includes a range of international organisations – Each performing its specific function. These include the European Union, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe. Our Organisation’s mandate is to protect and promote common standards in human rights, democracy and the rule of law. And I intend today to restrict my comments to these issues. There is certainly enough to say. And some of it is in fact positive. In the 73 years since the Council of Europe was created, it has grown from just 10 member states then, to 46 today. Each of these has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and is required to implement it – Just as they are required to implement and execute the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights – Which interprets the Convention – And to which every individual in Europe – Including every individual in Iceland – Has the ultimate right of appeal. Within this common legal area, human rights have greater definition and protection than at any time, or on any continent. This is death-penalty free zone – Where same-sex activity is legal – And where the conditions for arrest, prosecution and detention are robust, fair and humane. These – and so many other changes that have taken place over recent decades – Have transformed people’s lives for the better – And we owe that to the European Convention and to the Council of Europe. Sometimes it is said that human rights are theoretical. They are not. They are very real, and they touch our lives every day, even when we don’t realise it. This is true even in a very advanced country like Iceland. Cases from this country, brought before the Court, have for instance had an important impact in relation to resolving medical disputes and on free speech reforms. It’s important to realise that this continent-wide process has not stopped. Our human rights may be written in black and white. But the circumstances in which we live are not. In our fast-moving, tech-driven, modern societies, the Convention is still being interpreted and applied in light of the issues we face. It is, as the Strasbourg Court says, a living instrument – It continues to shape our everyday lives in ways that are important – Often unseen – And should never be taken for granted. The same is true for the specific instruments that we have developed to address particular problems – And which do so by drawing from the Convention’s principles. These cover everything from the prevention of torture, cybercrime and human trafficking – To the protection of women from violence, children from sexual exploitation, and national minorities from discrimination. Our European Social Charter also plays a vital role – With its rights to health, education and social security once again showing their value during the lockdowns required in many countries due to coronavirus. Moving forward, we are already at work on new instruments that will apply human rights standards to some of the defining challenges of our times. We are, for instance, developing new tools on human rights and environment – Recognising the ways in which increasing environmental harms undermine people’s rights to life, private and family life and property. And we have been working on a range of initiatives that address human rights and artificial intelligence. Because we recognise the range of ethical issues that come with AI. How do we stop algorithms from discriminating against groups or individuals? What happens when low-skilled jobs are replaced by machines? How can we prevent – or assign responsibility – for attacks on election systems, or technical failures including, for example, driverless cars? And among the tools that we have been developing, we are currently at work on a cross-cutting instrument – One that will help governments ensure that AI upholds fundamental rights – And does not undermine them. These priorities sit alongside others in the Council of Europe’s Strategic Framework – The implementation of the European Convention and the execution of the Strasbourg Court’s judgments, of course. But also measures to ensure freedom of expression, both online and offline – To ensure non-discrimination and the protection of vulnerable groups – To lead the fights against social inequalities and poverty – Inequality, racism, xenophobia and discrimination on grounds of religion – As well as against corruption, money laundering, and cybercrime – And human trafficking – And to ensure independent, efficient and resilient judicial systems – Alongside support for civil society, including human rights defenders. We are also supporting education for democratic citizenship and youth engagement – So that future generations understand the value of democracy – And are better equipped to defend it. At our recent Ministerial Sessions, member states have endorsed all of this. And restated their commitment to the values that underpin the Council of Europe – Including the multilateralism that ensures its progress. All of this is good. But I am not dismissing the clear and present dangers – There are recent examples of where our values have not held, but have in fact been pushed aside. In many of our member states, freedom of expression is under threat from restrictive legislation and efforts to intimidate, undermine and gag the media. Civic space is shrinking as laws are used – and misused – to prevent the freedom of assembly that is the lifeblood for any healthy democracy. And, in some places, we have witnessed a reactionary backlash against the hard-won rights of minorities and vulnerable groups, who have sometimes become the targets of violence. This is what happens when politics pulls at the threads of what we have fought so hard to create over the course of more than seven decades – And threatens the institutions that uphold it. Take the Russian Federation - Whose brutal, illegal and ongoing aggression against Ukraine is the most extreme example of its break with European standards. What should be our response to this? Last February, the Council of Europe moved quickly to exclude the Russian Federation from our Organisation. We are the only international organisation that has taken that step. And we were right to do so. Russia’s violent pivot away from our common values was a clear breach of our Statute – And its impact can be measured in the deaths, destruction and loss of livelihoods that have affected millions of people across Ukraine. To have kept Russia within our Organisation would have strained our credibility past breaking point. The Russian Federation does not respect our standards. And some lines simply cannot be crossed. Now our priority is to do everything that we can to help Ukraine and its people. That’s why we are supporting the Office of the Prosecutor General in the investigation of gross human rights violations on the ground – Why we have adapted our joint Action Plan for Ukraine to help its government apply our standards in light of the realities facing the country right now – And why we will be ready to help the country move forward with a specific package of measures tailored to the realities we find when the violence does eventually end. More than this, we are also working with those member states who have received the largest share of refugees from Ukraine – To help them provide the high standard of support that they wish to – And our Development Bank is providing grants to help with this process too. All of this has the support of our member states. They stand in solidarity with Ukraine. Their unity and determination gives meaning to our values – In the most difficult of situations – And it is testament to the underlying strength of the system that they have built, together – And its ongoing capacity to resist the drift away from the values codified in the European Convention. This, to be clear, is a matter of political will. In May of next year, they will have another opportunity to demonstrate their strength. Thanks to the hard and seamless work of our Organisation’s Italian and Irish Presidencies – And its new Icelandic Presidency too – The Council of Europe will have its Fourth Heads of State and Governments meeting, here in Reykjavik, next May. It will be for our member states to decide on the content of that meeting. They might consider what further support they can provide to Ukraine as it rebuilds – What we might do to help those other countries directly exposed to Russian aggression as they continue on the path of European integration – Often from outside the EU. And how we can work more closely with civil society actors from Russia and Belarus – So that we empower those who do not agree with the politics of aggression practiced by their national political leaders – And build on the first meeting of our new Contact Group on co-operation with representatives of Belarusian democratic forces and civil society. The recent report of our High-level Reflection Group addresses these and other issues on which member states might wish to reflect. More broadly, this will be an opportunity to take a clear-eyed view on the future of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe – To ensure the fullest commitment to the European Convention – And thereby halt and reverse the democratic backsliding that it is all too apparent and all too harmful. In our recent meeting, Prime Minister, you made a comment that has stayed with me. You said that you would like this country to host a Summit whose declaration deepens member states’ commitment to the Council of Europe’s values – And does not simply reaffirm them. That it should show an Organisation created in the aftermath of World War II – But relevant to the challenges of today. I could not agree more. But its future is not written or predestined. This will be determined by the will of its citizens - And of its governments and international organisations. They have turned the tide of political extremes before. With the tools at their disposal, and the political will required, they are more than able to do it again. Let next Spring’s Summit in Reykjavik be a central moment in writing the next, positive chapter in Europe’s rich and extraordinary history.

Migrant smuggling should belong to Europe’s past – Not its future – And, together, this is what we should aim to achieve. This will not be easy of course. Political upheaval, economic insecurity and climate change are just three of the key factors that are driving migration – That will continue to do so – And from which criminal gangs seek to profit. So, the question for us – For this conference – Is what we can do to better implement the tools that we have to hand in this fight – And what more can and should be done to address gaps – And ensure the enforcement and prosecution that will deter the smugglers? Certainly, a great deal of work has already been done by the international community. The Palermo Protocol supplementing the
UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime remains the important cornerstone of
what is – After all – A global challenge. UN agencies and bodies represented here today are also of course at work on this – As are various European Union actors – In line with the EU’s action plan on migrant smuggling – Which is doing important work to facilitate
co-operation within its member states – And on which the EU is now looking to build with a further legal and operational framework. The Council of Europe has also put in place a range of tools. Our conventions on International Co-operation on Criminal Matters – And on Cybercrime – Can be put to use by member states as they seek to tackle migrant smuggling and target those who make financial gain from it. So too can membership of other treaties – Including on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Importantly, many of these are open conventions – So that not only can our 46 member states benefit from them – But other parties can join too. On top of this, our European Committee on Crime Problems has been implementing its Action Plan on Fostering International Co-operation and Investigative Strategies in Fighting the Smuggling of Migrants. Among its key achievements has been setting up the Council of Europe’s Network of Prosecutors on Migrant Smuggling. This has been central to drawing up 30 country profiles – Complete with legal and judicial information on how migrant smuggling operates and is dealt with there – And the methods and dynamics of confronting it. I am grateful to all of the prosecutors – Many of whom are here today – And I know that your future work will lead to further success – Including in co-operation with Europol – The UNODC Working Group – And the Eurojust Group of Prosecutors on Migrant Smuggling – All of which have a stake in this challenge.
