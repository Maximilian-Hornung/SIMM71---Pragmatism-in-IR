Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is steadfast. And includes our long-standing opposition to the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of Crimea. But this Summit takes place in even more urgent and pressing circumstances than last year’s. The Council of Europe has been crystal clear in its condemnation of Russia’s brutal, illegal and ongoing aggression against Ukraine – And our member states were right to expel the country from our Organisation earlier this year. Now, our focus is on doing what we can to support Ukraine and its people. Our experts are helping the Office of the Prosecutor General as it investigates evidence of war crimes. With the Ukrainian authorities, we have agreed an adjusted action plan – Bolstering institutions, including the justice system and the media, given the challenges they now face. And we are helping member states support Ukrainian refugees who have fled. It is also important to acknowledge that the situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol has further deteriorated. I heard first-hand accounts of this suffering last November when I met activists and others at the administrative boundary line near Kherson. And I was also able to talk about the issues at stake with leaders of the Mejlis of Crimean Tatars, in May of this year. Since then, my team has held consultations with Tatar representatives – And with other human rights defenders and civil society activists – And we will continue to work with them on ways to shed light on human rights violations. In June, I presented my first report on the human rights situation in Crimea. And this was followed by a decision of our member states to continue their monitoring of the situation. There are obvious limits to what can be done given the reality on the ground. But we will do all that we can. And our approach will respond as circumstances change. This is true for Crimea – And for all of Ukraine. While in the country earlier this year, I was able to assure President Zelenskyy that the Council of Europe will continue to stand in solidarity with his country – As we all seek a just, sustainable peace, grounded in international law – In which every Ukrainian is able to benefit from the human rights, democracy and rule of law standards that are theirs by right. And finally congratulations on your Independence Day.

The decision by the Latvian Presidency of our Committee of Ministers to hold this informal Conference – Is a welcome demonstration of our collective determination. We all wish for peace in Ukraine. But that peace must be sustainable. To be sustainable it must be just. And, to be just, it must have accountability at its core. At our Summit of Heads of State and Government in May, European leaders were clear about this. Their Reykjavík Declaration called for “comprehensive accountability” and specific steps. These included establishing a Register of Damage at the Council of Europe – To record the loss and destruction being inflicted by Russia. Four months later, that Register has 44 members from across 3 continents – so far. It has an Executive Director, a Secretariat and, at the Second meeting of its Conference of Parties – Held here tomorrow – It will take important decisions, notably for the establishment of its Board. Situated in The Hague, soon with an office in Kyiv, the speed with which the Register is taking shape shows our strong intent – And it will benefit from generous financial contributions, for which I am most grateful. The Register is a first and necessary step towards any future compensation mechanism. On this, the Council of Europe is ready to contribute its expertise in whatever way is helpful. Similarly, on creating a special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine – European leaders were explicit : “The Council of Europe should participate in consultations and negotiations and provide concrete expert and technical support.” Our commitment to this is absolute.

This extraordinary, ground-breaking treaty drew from the lessons of the time, but it was not meant to protect human rights only in the circumstances of that moment. Rather, it was written as a set of timeless principles that should be applied to all aspects of life on our continent in any and every age. A “living instrument” that keep pace with the issues we face – Whether they are familiar, evolving or new. In fact, the rapid development of digital technology and the use of algorithms is providing us with insights and opportunities that were previously unthinkable. And as we continue to push at the boundaries of the possible, there will be further rewards in terms of what we know, how we spend our time, and how our economies develop. But there are also dangers. The development and operation of AI systems remains opaque. Accountability and responsibility are difficult to define and enforce. And automated decisions raise the prospect of bias and discrimination, with vulnerable groups most at risk. This must be addressed. Technology should open new horizons, not restrict people’s access to their fundamental rights. So, that’s our challenge: To make sure that AI upholds our legal standards and does not undermine them. National initiatives, ethical codes and other non-binding instruments are not to be dismissed. But the reality is that artificial intelligence systems are designed, deployed and operated across national borders. The opportunities and the problems are shared and felt between states, and a multilateral approach is required. This is the key to harmonising rules, levelling the playing field, and establishing strong and equal legal protection to which all Europeans have a right – with proper oversight. It was with this in mind that we established our Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence just over two years ago.

This right is a cornerstone of free, pluralistic, democratic societies in which individuals can share their thoughts and contribute their ideas without fear of undue sanction. Over the years, the challenges to Article 10 have been many and varied. And the text itself, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, and various other Council of Europe tools have guided national governments in how they should protect this right. Including circumstances in which they should act proactively. SLAPPs are one of the more recent challenges to have emerged. And this problem must be addressed. SLAPPs are based on the arbitrary, opportunist and vexatious use of legislation – Laws that cover defamation, national security and anti-extremism and anti-terrorism. They can be based in civil, administrative or criminal proceedings. And they can be launched by private interests, often powerful individuals and companies, or by state actors. Either way, they are intended to intimidate, to limit public debate, and to prevent the free flow of legitimate information – Not least by encouraging self-censorship – And their chilling effect spreads not only from lawsuits that have been filed, but from the very prospect that this might happen. Authors, academics and bloggers. Anti-corruption groups, civil society organisations and human rights defenders. The list goes on. But heading it are journalists and media workers. This profession plays a vital role, as a “public watchdog”, providing citizens with news, information and ideas. Again and again the Court has underlined their importance to the healthy operation of a genuine democracy. So, it is perhaps unsurprising that they should be bearing a particular brunt when it comes to the use of SLAPPs. Our Platform to Promote the Protection of Journalism and the Safety of Journalists has done good work highlighting the nature and extent of this challenge. In recent years an increasing number of SLAPPS has been reported to the Platform, which illuminate the range of ways in which laws are being used and misused against journalists. This was further outlined in the Platform’s most recent annual report – And in the Council of Europe’s book “A Mission to Inform – Journalists at risk speak out”. It used case studies to show the ways in which lengthy procedures, financial pressure and the mere threat of criminal sanctions can be used as weapons to silence critical voices. One example is the very important case of Daphne Caruana Galizia which was already mentioned. At the time of Ms Galizia’s murder, she was facing more than 40 libel and defamation lawsuits in retaliation for her criticism of powerful political and business figures.

But for each of these to function there must be justice. And that means just rules, enforced by a just system that maintains public trust. We should never be afraid to ask whether we are doing this as well as possible, in the interest of individuals and society as a whole. In fact, asking this question is our duty. So, I congratulate the Italian Presidency of the Committee of Ministers on its decision to make “building a people-centred future” one of its key priorities; And, specifically, its focus on reaffirming the function of punishment both as a moment for rehabilitation of the offender and of restoration for the victim. These issues, which you will consider today and tomorrow, are dynamic. It is therefore right to reflect together on the experience of them in our member states. Certainly, we are not starting from scratch. Three years ago, our Committee of Ministers adopted a recommendation on restorative justice in criminal matters. It defines that restorative justice as a process enabling those harmed by crime, and those responsible for that harm - if they freely consent - to participate actively in the resolution of that offence. This should be done with the help of a trained and impartial facilitator. And it often involves dialogue between the victim and the offender, though other people affected directly or indirectly may be involved too. The 2018 recommendation urges national authorities to pass legislation making restorative justice available and accessible at all stages of the criminal justice system, so that it can be used where appropriate. Progress on this has been uneven. And I encourage all member states to look again at whether they might do more to implement the terms of the recommendation.

I think that all of us here this evening agree about the creeping of authoritarian tendencies here in Europe – And in other parts of the world – And the need for a renewed and effective response. I want to say from the outset that this is absolutely achievable. I salute her courage, determination and principles. She makes a powerful case for democracy in her country– For the benefit of all who live there. And the Council of Europe is proud to have established a Contact Group that is working with civil society and democratic forces from Belarus – To share insights and provide training based on European standards. Sviatlana knows – As democracy activists around the world have always known – That the form of government they seek is the only route to freedom, fairness and dignity. To choose who is in power, not have them imposed on us. To be free to think our own thoughts and express them without fear or favour. To have a justice system that is worthy of the name – Protecting the innocent, prosecuting the guilty, and standing strong against corruption – These and other qualities are inherent to the peace, prosperity and inclusion that define effective and functioning democracies – And which are anathema to autocrats. Billions of people around the world benefit from democracy – And billions more would give all that they have for that chance. The yearning remains real. But so too is the will of some to defy it. For years now, the Council of Europe has been warning about the rise of authoritarianism – Rooted in the return of extreme populism and nationalism on many parts of our continent. My most recent annual report identified the trends in democratic backsliding that accompany this – And making clear what European governments must do to reverse them. What kind of problems are we talking about? Freedom of expression is being restricted – With journalists facing problems ranging from Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation –
so-called SLAPPS – to stymie their work – Through to threats, violence and even murder – sometimes with impunity. Freedom of assembly and association are being curtailed – With laws – including anti-terror laws – used, misused and introduced to limit legitimate and peaceful protest – And to shrink civic space. And the independence of the judiciary is being threatened – With changes to the rules governing the appointment of judges – So that politicians’ power is extended – And the separation of powers is threatened. Enabling these examples and others is the culture that comes with authoritarianism – The blaming and scapegoating that polarises political debate – Turns up the volume of hate speech – And spawns anti-rights movements – From anti-women, to anti-LGBTI, to anti-migrant and refugee. Russia presents the most extreme example of this descent into authoritarian politics – A decline that has resulted in a brutal and illegal war of aggression for which Ukrainians are paying an horrific price. So, it is vitally important that governments meet the standards that stop the rot setting in. The Council of Europe provides the extensive and practical tools that help them do this. Examples include our 2016 recommendation to all European governments on the protection of journalism and the safety of journalists – Our current Europe-wide campaign on the same issue – And an imminent recommendation on countering SLAPPS. Similarly, we have a 2018 Recommendation to member states on the need to strengthen the protection and promotion of civic space – And another from last year on promoting youth civil society and young people and supporting their participation in democratic processes. And our Venice Commission on Democracy through Law has issued a series of opinions, reports and studies on the independence of judges – With clear guidance on how this can be achieved. In answer to anti-rights movements, relevant tools include our Gender Equality Strategy and Recommendation on Preventing and Combating Sexism – Last year’s General Policy Recommendation on preventing and combating intolerance and discrimination against LGBTI persons – And specific initiatives designed to meet the needs of migrants and refugees and the communities who receive them – And that can benefit from them. We want young people to know the value of all of this. So that they neither live in ignorance, nor take their democratic inheritance for granted – But are instead equipped with the skills they need to defend democracy whenever and wherever it comes under attack. That is why we have put so much stock on teaching competences for democratic culture – And why renewing the democratic and civic mission of education – Including online – Is a key part of our new Education Strategy. These are just a few examples. Democracy is a key pillar of the Council of Europe’s work – And our ever-evolving standard-setting, monitoring and co-operation activities are designed to help member states move forward – But their success requires determined, political engagement. For all that this is being called into question, there are reasons to be optimistic. Our tools are put to extensive and effective use by our member states – And in May, at our Reykjavík Summit of Heads of State and Government – European leaders went further, recommitting to the values and standards of the Council of Europe. This included adopting the Reykjavík Principles of Democracy. These crystallise what it means to be an effective democracy today. The introduction states directly that member states will “prevent and resist democratic backsliding… “And stand firm against authoritarian tendencies.” There must be democratic participation – Including free and fair elections in line with international standards – Independent and effective institutions, including parliaments and judiciaries – A safe and enabling environment for civil society. The Reykjavík Principles are a means by which to measure the health of our democracies – And an impetus for further work – And we will establish a committee that will support member states in meeting these aspirations – So that democracy stops sliding back and, instead, moves forward. Ladies and gentlemen, this week I spoke twice at the World Forum for Democracy in Strasbourg. This is attended by young people from a diverse range of countries. Hundreds of them, from all continents. I was struck by their energy, their enthusiasm, their commitment to democracy – And their hunger for the rights that come with it. This was clear not just from their words – But from the innovative projects that they are leading on the ground. Governments should learn from this. They must not encroach on freedom and innovation – Or undermine their promise. They must not merely hold the line against authoritarianism – But advance, reclaim the territory that has been lost – And plant the flag proudly for a fully democratic future. I wish you all a successful conference. NA

In doing so, it is important to remind ourselves of how the terror started. What became the Shoah did not start with physical attacks. It began with the gradual dehumanisation of the Jewish people: Through the use of hateful words, slander, and conspiracy theories that fed on anti-Jewish sentiment that had long existed in parts of Europe. This rhetoric was followed by a series of laws and edicts, passed under Nazi rule, with the aim of isolating, discrediting and delegitimising Jewish people, their culture and religion. All of this culminated in the so-called Reichskristallnacht - the night of broken glass – when over one thousand synagogues and Jewish shops in Germany and Austria were set on fire and destroyed. But this terrible event was the precursor of yet worse to come: the systemic murder of millions of people across our continent. Jews of course, and many other victims too. So, as we remember the Shoah and vow that it should “Never Again” happen in Europe – or anywhere – it is important to sharpen our senses: to look and listen for the first signs of danger in our societies – developments that could escalate to systematic violence and deadly attacks on minorities – not only on Jews, but others including Muslims, Roma, immigrants and members of the LGBTI community. We have witnessed this in recent years, exacerbated by a pandemic that has exposed vulnerable groups to even greater risk of marginalisation and discrimination, both online and offline, often in the form of physical attacks.

Never again to war, destruction, and genocide – And all the horrors from which the continent suffered during two world wars. Instead of brutal power politics – And the abuse of state power – There would be common standards in human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. Putting into effect the European Convention on Human Rights – The European Court of Human Rights – And all the tools and treaties that have followed has required compromise, determination, and political will. European governments have, for example, abolished the death penalty – Acted to prevent torture – And extended new protections to national and language minorities – Often in the face of public opposition. But they did these things because they were required, legally - and morally. What is now asked of you – Europe’s leaders – is no harder – But just as important.

To know the facts about COVID-19 is to know how to best protect yourself, your loved ones and your broader community. And a free media is essential to ensure that this information is trusted, reliable and widespread. There is no substitute for quality, fact-checked journalism. So, it is both an irony and a tragedy that freedom of information and expression are facing extreme pressure in Europe today: With traditional media in many Council of Europe member states in decline over recent years – A decline that has intensified thanks to the very pandemic that has underlined its necessity. The good news is that this slide is not inevitable: it can be stopped. But to do that, we need to be clear about the root causes and the remedies required. So, what are these problems? Without question, they include the rise of violence and attacks directed towards journalists. Over recent years, our Platform for the Protection of Journalism and the Safety of Journalists has recorded an upward trend in these chilling tactics, which have included murders, and a high level of impunity. During the pandemic, such incidents have risen in number. In some countries, the volume of politicians and officials’ anti-media rhetoric has gone up, accusations about the spread of fake news have been levied against journalists, and public hostility has been stoked. Consequently, media workers have been subject to assaults and to arrests and police hindrance while reporting on protests and demonstrations. And, on occasion, they have also become the target of demonstrators angered by media coverage of COVID-19. Over the past year, some national authorities have sought greater control over what the media can report. Yes, many governments have taken proactive steps to inform the public about coronavirus, running websites, hotlines and regular press conferences with government figures and health experts. But others have taken measures to restrict journalists’ access to these events, their ability to ask questions, and their freedom to travel. Delays in processing requests to access for information also became apparent. And this reduced access to information and places gives cause for concern. So too does COVID-related disinformation and the measures that have been introduced with the stated aim of countering it. It is true that fake or distorted news can spread panic and erode trust in institutions. And equally true that social media platforms, where falsehoods thrive, are often still not doing enough to stem the flow of misinformation. But responses that criminalise the spread of “disinformation” and direct the removal of material from public view have presented problems of their own. Non-judicial takedown requests, the blocking of websites, broadcasting bans, the closure of media outlets, the arrest of journalists for their work on the pandemic frontline: We have seen all of these. And given the different interpretations that can be applied to fake news, there is a real risk that regulations criminalising it can be abused. Only assertions that are blatantly false and which pose a clear risk to public health should be banned. More broadly, we have seen a deepening of the financial crisis and the crisis of trust that has afflicted the media throughout the last decade. Falling sales and advertising revenue for traditional media were made worse by lockdowns and their economic impact. This lack of a sustainable business model has hit local and regional media particularly hard, with smaller outlets often bought out or closing altogether. And yes, research shows that during the pandemic television, radio and press were more trusted sources of news than other outlets, including social media. But even so, only 38% of people say that they trust news media most of the time. As budgets are strained, quality falls, and disinformation grows, there is a worrying, general tendency towards “news scepticism” when people most need to have faith in what they hear. So, what’s to be done? I have no doubt that this Conference will act as a catalyst for new ideas, and that is to be welcomed. But this is not a standing start. The Council of Europe has already developed many tools that can be used by member states to address these issues. Freedom of expression, information and assembly are guaranteed by the European Court of Human Rights. And its case law is there to be implemented and executed, fully, swiftly and without exception. We have a recommendation and implementation guide for member states on the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists: And a further recommendation on the roles and responsibilities of internet intermediaries. Our Tromsø Convention on Access to Official Documents came into force just five months ago recognising a general right of access to official documents held by public authorities, and on which further ratifications will be important. And our Committee of Ministers’ Declaration on the financial sustainability of quality journalism in the digital age is there to help national authorities too. It makes clear the importance of introducing beneficial tax regimes and media development support to counter the financial strain in the sector. Recognising journalism as a public good, carrying-out media and information literacy initiatives to strengthen the public’s critical thinking, and the introduction of fact-checking services are all important too. These will reinforce quality journalism, and people’s trust in it. We have also issued a tailor-made response to the specific situation caused by COVID-19. Last April, I issued a toolkit document to our 47 member states. Its aim was to support them in taking measures that counter the public health crisis and uphold our standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It included a chapter dedicated specifically to freedom of expression and information, media freedom and access to official information. And it was followed by an information document some months after, elaborating on these issues in the context of the ongoing crisis. The current situation is also outlined in a dedicated chapter of my 2021 annual report, A Democratic Renewal for Europe, sent to our member states’ governments today. And many of these issues will be addressed further at our Conference of Ministers responsible for media and information society when it meets in June. But I hope that this webinar will provide further food for thought about what member states should do and what further steps might be taken at the international level. Because there remains a strong public appetite for reliable media, providing accurate information during the current pandemic and in general terms too. But in the current environment, that won’t just happen. Rather, we must all play our role in creating the conditions for trust. And I am grateful to the German Presidency of our Committee of Ministers for providing this opportunity to explore what more we can do. I wish you every success in your deliberations.

Together, our 46 member states set European standards in human rights, democracy and the rule of law. This ensures the greater unity that, in turn, underpins peace on our continent. But that peace requires member states to meet the commitments that they have undertaken – Which, in turn, requires political will. This requires leadership and commitment. Russia did not lose that will all-of-a-sudden, last February – But piece by piece, over years. One of the lessons learned is that we needed to take action earlier. The occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol was one terrible moment in that timeline. The aggression that began last year is the bloodiest. We cannot force Russia to meet the standards of modern civilisation to which its Black Sea neighbours are committed – But we are here to help those neighbours – So that they can promote democratic security in their own countries, and between one another. Both are crucial and important. This includes our specific, resolute support for Ukraine. Our joint Action Plan for Resilience, Recovery and Reconstruction – Our efforts to help meet the needs of Ukrainian refugees seeking safety in our other member states – And our determination that the ongoing violence ends – and this is what is important – in a just peace – With accountability at its heart. That is why we are supporting the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s investigations into serious human rights violations since early March 2022 – And why I have proposed – to move from words to action – that the Council of Europe should set up a Register of Damage – To support victims and record the losses that continue to mount, we need a victims-centered approach. I hope that member states will agree to it at our Fourth Summit of Heads and State and Governments next month – And pave the way to a compensation mechanism. My annual reports on the human rights situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol – And the terrible reality of what is happening in other parts of Ukraine make one thing very clear: The best, most secure future for the Black Sea region is based on democratic principles and the rule of international law. We will do everything that we can to help achieve that.
