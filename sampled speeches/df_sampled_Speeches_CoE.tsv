One that continues to have a deep and positive effect on the lives of people across our continent. Employment and housing; Health and education; Social protection and welfare; These provide us with dignity, security and opportunity – both as individuals and as a society; And the Charter has helped extend them across the map of Europe. Equally, it is clear about the particular need to care for the most vulnerable in our societies: Including children, the elderly, migrants and those with disabilities. And our success in supporting those most in need is certainly a mark of civilisation. But there are challenges: significant challenges. In recent years, extreme nationalism and populist politics has been on the rise in parts of Europe. And those who advocate it often attack the very concept of human rights, and the multilateral institutions that uphold them. While some countries continue to use the Charter as a guide, and to ensure that social rights are a reality of life, others have stalled or even selected reverse gear. Rising poverty levels, widening inequalities, the erosion of employment rights: These are just some of the harms that blight lives in Europe today. And there is no doubt that the impact of covid-19 has the potential to make this situation worse. In times of crisis, it is often those who have least that suffer most. And throughout the ongoing pandemic, we have seen member states struggle to provide adequate healthcare, access to education, and advice, support and provision for minority groups. This story is not yet complete. The longer-term economic impact of the coronavirus has yet to be felt. And ensuring individuals’ social rights is necessary to prevent deeper fissures opening up in Europe: To prevent a public health crisis morphing into a democratic crisis too. So, what would progress look like? We need governments to meet the commitments that they have made. Beyond that, we need to persuade those countries that have not ratified the revised European Social Charter to go ahead and do so. And for all governments to consider which further provisions they should accept and the benefits of joining the collective complaints procedure: This, after all, is key for accountability and for helping guide governments in meeting their social rights obligations in the interests of the people they serve.

In times of war, that job is even more important and more difficult. The stakes are so high – And the suffering so great – That people need access to timely, reliable information more than ever. But providing it comes at extraordinary risk to the women and men who dedicate their lives to this work. Since the beginning of the Russian Federation’s brutal, illegal and ongoing aggression – Ukrainian media outlets have been closed, TV towers shelled, and camera crews attacked – While an ever-increasing number of journalists have been wounded, tortured and killed. Many have simply disappeared. This is not only tragic and appalling – But directing attacks against journalists – people who are not taking part directly in the hostilities – constitutes a war crime. Where such crimes have been committed, everything must be done to investigate them and to hold those responsible to account. At our Ministerial Session in Turin last month, our member states agreed to our joint, adjusted Action Plan for Ukraine. This includes tailor-made measures in support of the safety of journalists and the media – And to ensure access to information in Ukraine. But the stark reality remains that this profession is exposed to dangers that cannot be fully mitigated on the ground. Today in Ukraine there are journalists, reporters, and bloggers – Fixers, operators and camera people – Who are laying their lives on the line to document the crimes committed against their country – Including war crimes. Their commitment and their bravery are humbling. This exhibition shows specific examples of what their courage enables. And I am thankful to the Permanent Representation – To the Ukrainian delegation to our Parliamentary Assembly – To the CSO Institute of Mass Information – And to PromoUkraina for bringing it here. But most of all, we are grateful to the journalists and media workers themselves. Our thoughts are with them, those close to them, and all Ukrainians.

It is now two years since the Russian Federation launched its terrible full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine – And the injustice of it continues to burn. Our thoughts today are with the Ukrainian people. We think of those who have been killed whether on the front line, or on the streets, or in their homes – We think of those who have suffered injuries or the destruction of their homes, livelihoods and communities – And we think of those millions of refugees who have fled their country in search of safety – Or who have been deported or forcibly displaced to Russia, or Russian-controlled territory – A fate that has befallen many children. But while our deepest sympathy is with the Ukrainian people – So too have they won our greatest respect. Two years into this aggression, their spirit remains strong – Incredibly strong. Despite all the suffering and hardship, they remain resolute in their determination to defend their country – To reclaim their territory – And to rebuild a democratic Ukraine, cast in yellow and blue – The colours of their own flag, which now flies in solidarity on buildings throughout this continent – And the colours that call to mind European unity and the institutions that underpin it.

Under its various guises, this institution has a long and distinguished history in the study of international affairs, and in the education of those who have gone on to influence them. Indeed, since the establishment of what was the Oriental Academy in 1754, this city has been at the centre of enormous political change in Europe and the world, including the rise and fall of an empire of which it was a capital. So, this is a fitting place in which to discuss the changes in our current political environment too. Those changes are real and manifest. In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential contest in the United States, plus other election results and events, the foreign affairs environment continues to evolve in ways that may not yet be fully understood. But there is a clear sense that multilateralism is less predictable and a related concern that promoting and protecting universal standards of human rights is becoming harder at a time when those standards are as relevant as ever. So, we are right to ask ourselves whether the opportunity still exists for human rights to put down deeper and more secure roots or whether there is a real danger that they will perish in the cold reality of contemporary international politics. As Secretary General of the Council of Europe, I want to give my perspective on the position of our fundamental rights on this continent today. In order to do that, I want to first set some context. Tuesday of this week marked the United Nations’ annual Human Rights Day. And it was the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 that laid the foundations of Europe’s human rights laws. Shocked by the unparalleled horrors of the Second World War – the Holocaust first among them – world leaders understood the need for change: They understood that by defining the human rights that belong to every individual, and elevating those rights above national law, they could better protect the dignity of humankind. The following year – 70 years ago – the Council of Europe was founded. Drawing on the content of the Universal Declaration, its member states drafted the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, which came into force three years later. The rights to life, privacy, expression, a fair trial, liberty and security, conscience and religion – and freedom from discrimination, servitude, and torture. These are just some of the rights guaranteed by the European Convention, for the people, to prevent the arbitrary use of state power. The Council of Europe had ten founding member states in 1949. Today, we are a pan-European family of 47 countries – and each has ratified the Convention. It is interpreted and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights, to which everyone in the jurisdiction of those member states has the ultimate right of individual appeal. And, alongside the European Social Charter, it enshrines the fundamental rights to which 830 million Europeans are entitled by law. The Council of Europe applies these rights to specific challenges by developing new legal instruments on the basis of agreed common standards. These include conventions on the prevention of torture, on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, against the trafficking of human organs and human beings, and cybercrime. Other instruments aim to protect children against sexual exploitation and abuse, national minorities and regional or minority languages, and our personal data. And the Council of Europe also supports the role of sports, culture and education, where equality, inclusion and democratic citizenship are key. For seven decades now, this Organisation has expanded in size and output, to the benefit of millions of Europeans. But there is also no doubt that we are in a period of relative backlash. In parts of Europe today, human rights are more frequently violated and their legitimacy called into question. A heady mixture of extreme nationalism and populism has emerged, whose advocates often regard the international rule of law as an obstacle to action rather than a guarantor of individuals’ rights. This puts international organisations such as the Council of Europe and, in particular, the European Court of Human Rights in the line of populist fire. And it matters because it is part of a bigger strategy: to attack or undermine the very concept of individual, fundamental rights which exist above national law, and thereby to weaken the protection they offer. Let me give you some examples of what this looks like in practice. Freedom of expression is enshrined by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This protects the right of individuals to form, hold and express their own opinions without undue interference. But over recent years, studies of the freedom of expression in Europe have shown that it is under heightened threat. We also witness it through the alerts put by our partners, leading journalists’ associations with whom I met last week in Paris, on our Platform to promote the protection of journalism and safety of journalists. Violence against journalists has increased significantly over the last decade. This includes physical attacks, intimidation, harassment, targeted surveillance and cyberbullying. Last year, the number of threats doubled, and there have been high-profile cases of murder. Impunity for such attacks is a problem despite the fact that the state has a duty to fully investigate such incidents. And the effect of all of this is to silence critical voices and inhibit free speech. Smear campaigns and inflammatory rhetoric by senior politicians, often followed by social media activity, also undermine the ability of journalists, media actors and others to do their jobs. Also online, we have witnessed the rise of fake news, hate speech and misuse of anti-terrorism legislation to curtail freedom of expression. Traditional threats to media freedom and independence also persist, including government shutdowns of media outlets, the growing threat to the protection of journalists’ sources, and restrictions on the editorial and financial independence of public service media. Non-governmental organisations, human rights defenders, and other civil society actors also play a crucial role in holding the powerful to account. For this, their freedom of assembly and association are essential, as guaranteed by Article 11 of the European Convention. Here too there are increasing problems. Verbal attacks and restrictive legislation often result in a shrinking civic space. A study by the European Commission for Democracy through Law – the Venice Commission – found that, in many member states, specific obligations have been imposed on associations receiving funding from abroad. Such regularity frameworks are sometimes selectively enforced in a bid to hamper, restrict, or silence specific civil society actors. There has been a trend in the use of anti-terrorism legislation to restrict freedom of assembly too. Legislative amendments have given priority to certain types of gathering, to the possible detriment of others, and there have been undue bans on assemblies and parades including, for example, those organised by LGBTI communities, with a number of examples this year. The arrest and conviction of peaceful participants in assemblies who pose no threat to public order remains a problem, as does the use of disproportionate measures targeting well-known public figures. Taken alongside the forced dispersal of peaceful events and concerns about the use of force by security services, it is clear that these tactics have the potential to deter members of the public from attending legitimate demonstrations. When it comes to anti-discrimination and equality, there has been a dramatic rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim hatred and online hate speech across the continent. And data shows that when such verbal transgressions are left unchallenged, they are a first step in escalating racial discrimination and even violent racist attacks. In some member states there have been crackdowns on LGBTI people. And, regarding gender equality, persistent failure by some countries to close the gap sits alongside retrogressive measures in others. Unequal power structures persist, as do threats to women’s rights defenders; unequal access to employment and financial resources; gender bias and stereotypes; sexism and discrimination, including sexist hate speech online and offline and in political discourse; and budget cuts that are often applied to gender equality bodies and authorities. Closely related to this is the ever-present problem of gender-based violence, which leaves millions of women in Europe fearing for their personal safety and security, and suffering from the physical and psychological impact of abuse. The rights of national minorities have also been in the spotlight, with examples of hard-won rights being diminished. In some countries, the tendency to emphasise the importance of the state language as a unifying factor has gone hand in hand with measures that diminish the protection of minority languages. This is deeply concerning given that history has shown us that the strong protection of minority rights is key to maintaining high levels of political stability. The same can be said of social rights. Reports show that overall inequality has increased in Europe over recent years, both between and within countries, and that this leads to political polarization and strain on social cohesion. There are a number of reasons for this inequality: Technological change and the impact on the labour market; the fall-out from the economic crisis that began over ten years ago; and the consequences of related austerity measures adopted by some governments. Where public spending cuts for public services and social provision have been deep – in the areas of health and housing or social security and pensions, for example – the impact has been heaviest on the most vulnerable: The poor, the elderly, the sick; people with disabilities; migrants and refugees. Evidence also suggests that changes to welfare impact disproportionately on women and that the effect of austerity measures is to make the labour market less accessible to young people and to Roma and migrants. All of this makes social rights harder to maintain. Significant budget cuts can also harm the quality of judicial services, and therefore the fulfillment of judicial rights. More generally, a strong, effective and independent judiciary is needed in order to ensure the fair application of human rights at the domestic level, free from political pressure. But here too there are problems. Over recent years, there has been an increase in efforts at interfering in the composition of national judiciaries, including constitutional courts. In several countries, key politicians – including government ministers – have alleged that the judiciary is corrupt or politicised, or elite and remote. On some occasions this has led to action or legislation asserting executive powers over the judiciary or prosecutors. This has involved the removal and appointment of judges, including supreme court judges, the removal of court presidents and the establishment of new courts, and broad reforms to high judicial councils. In some cases, combined amendments to judicial laws, the criminal code and the criminal procedure code have seemed to directly undermine the independence of judges and prosecutors, and the effectiveness of criminal justice. And broad powers exercised by the executive – sometimes by a justice minister – have led to concerns about the independent functioning of the judiciary. Among these are cases of ordinary courts refusing to execute judgments of a constitutional court. This not only raises issues relating to the separation of powers in a healthy democracy, but it means that the execution of cases that relate to human rights laws are also put at risk. Ladies and gentlemen, this list of problems is non-exhaustive: There are others. But as serious as these issues are, and as much as Council of Europe member states are rightly obliged to address them, they are not by themselves a fair representation of where human rights stand overall. I began this afternoon with a brief outline of the Council of Europe’s role, development yetand work. But we should be clear about the full significance of that. What has been built is a common legal space that has paved the way for pan-European standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the like of which has never been seen before: In Europe, or anywhere else in the world. Today, our legally-binding Convention system, complete with an international court issuing judgments, comprises more than 220 conventions, and various other instruments. These have resulted in countless legislative acts and policy initiatives at the domestic level that have embedded a human rights culture in Europe: Giving practical effect to rights that are now regarded as routine, and sometimes taken for granted. Discrimination against children born outside marriage is illegal in Europe because of the European Court of Human Rights’ interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Similarly, judgments from the Strasbourg Court have clarified that homosexual relationships cannot be criminalized; That arbitrary mass surveillance of our daily communications is illegal; That suspects have a right to legal assistance while in police custody; And that there is a right to legal aid for those who cannot afford lawyers’ fees but who need access to a court. Similarly, the ratification of our conventions has helped member states across Europe – and often countries from further afield – to meet European standards. Take for example the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Or the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which includes measures to protect against human rights abuses online. Or the Lanzarote Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse: A treaty that requires member states to criminalise all kinds of sexual offences against children: And to prevent sexual violence, to protect child victims and to prosecute the perpetrators. All of these Conventions have monitoring committees that assess member states’ implementation and support them to do better. But they are just three of the many treaties and instruments by which human rights standards continue to improve on our continent. Good news rarely makes headlines, but significant progress has been made over the decades. We all benefit from this and it deserves recognition. Even in those areas where I have outlined worrying trends, it is important to understand that there are also positive developments. There are member states that have taken steps recently to shore up freedom of expression, including added protection for journalists, and support for public broadcasting. Some national authorities have acted to ensure freedom of assembly and association, amending legislation and adjusting practice to better align them with European Convention standards, with changes to notification procedures and to the handling of public assembly, for example. Concerning anti-discrimination, most European countries have now established equality bodies; Many have adopted national Roma integration strategies – albeit with limited implementation; And in many others, there have been considerable improvements in attitudes towards LGBTI people and legislative initiatives on same-sex partnerships, marriage and the rights of transgender people. With regard to women, awareness of gender inequality and violence has been heightened in the #MeToo era, and a number of countries are taking steps towards preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence in line with the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention. The gender pay gap has also narrowed, if slowly and by too little. Individual problems relating to the use of minority languages continue to flare up. But for the most part this issue is contained. Legal protections are provided by the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Charter for Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of Minorities. This is important given the range of minority language issues that remain in the Balkans and the Baltic states, in the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Ukraine and elsewhere. And when it comes to judicial independence, several Council of Europe member states have made positive reforms, setting-up merit-based appointment and evaluation systems, effective judicial councils and solid professional training. This can only be good for ensuring compliance with human rights laws, and the rule of law in general. For a further perspective on the progress that is being made, we should look to the European Court of Human Rights itself. The Court has not been spared from the wrath of populist attack. There has been criticism of the Court’s efficiency. And its authority over national courts and constitutions has been challenged. This has taken the form of constitutional change, judicial reforms and referendums, and has often been sparked by controversy generated by a small number of the Court’s judgments. But the reality is this: Overall, member states comply fully and swiftly with its judgments, as they are obliged to do. A decade-long reform process has helped reduce the backlog of pending cases from 150,000 in 2011 to around 60,000 today. And no member state has bluntly refused to execute the Court’s judgments on the basis of national sovereignty. Indeed, when it comes to the execution of judgments overall, the number of cases closed by the Council of Europe has reached an all-time high, thanks to a new policy of enhanced dialogue by member states. That is not to say that there have been no genuine problems. There have been cases of member states being unco-operative on specific cases, and it is right that we should take appropriate action where these occur. But today the European Court of Human Rights – the ultimate arbiter on Europe’s human rights laws – is effective and efficient. For human rights to remain effective, they must also be applied to changing circumstances and emerging challenges. This continues to happen. The Council of Europe is currently working with member states towards the wider implementation of social rights. And we are looking at further action to tackle human trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation: A scandal in twenty first century Europe. Similarly, we are continuing our work of recent years to help member states ensure that the increased numbers of migrants and refugees arriving on Europe’s shores have their human rights respected. It is not the Council of Europe’s job to manage migration, but it is national authorities’ obligation to treat all people on European soil in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. To that end, we have helped member states to maintain appropriate standards in reception centres and accommodation, to provide access to services, and to treat minors – especially unaccompanied children – with the sensitivity and protection they need. In November of this year, we established an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence to examine the feasibility and potential elements of a legal framework for the development, design and application of AI. Because new technologies raise important questions about the future of human rights. AI has implications for the ways in which our elections are fought and conducted. It has already made a significant impact on some employment sectors, with a disproportionate impact on the female workforce. And algorithms can be used to profile individuals online, resulting in selective recommendations on everything, from what we read to what job adverts we see. So, the time is right to look at what further measures might be introduced to ensure that the future of AI enhances our human rights, rather than undermining them. And I look forward to hearing the Ad Hoc Committee’s recommendations next year. Lastly, I am also determined that the Council of Europe must act to better protect and promote human rights in unresolved conflict areas and so-called grey zones. Every individual in our member states should be fully protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, regardless of de facto control or the status of a given area. And it is the Secretary General’s responsibility to seek access for relevant Council of Europe bodies. Ladies and gentlemen, my intention this afternoon is not to play down the risks for the future of human rights in Europe. Those risks are real. What has fanned the flames of populism is up for debate. Disillusionment with contemporary politics? Perhaps economic hardship and inequality, writ large in the aftermath of a deep recession? Or the loss of historical memory as the circumstances and logic of the post-1945 world order fade in people’s minds? Maybe all of these play a role. But if we want human rights to remain a firm fixture in the constellation of European justice, we need to be clear that these rights exist not as a tool for political elites; Rather, they are tools that belong to every European as a means of protection against those elites. And we need governments to accept that logic and to uphold the system. At our Ministerial Session in Helsinki earlier this year, foreign ministers from across our member states committed to doing precisely that. And, equally, I hope that all of you here today will remain vigilant and be ready to defend and promote our fundamental rights wherever you see attempts to uundermine them. Because the pan-European human rights standards achieved in our common legal space is a great success story of our modern times. Today, there is no death penalty in use in any one of our 47 member states. That is because the death penalty is illegal under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights. What a symbolic, but substantive achievement. It is unthinkable that this progress could be put into reverse. Just as it is unthinkable that all the standards raised by the implementation of the European Convention, the Social Charter and our substantial acquis could be set aside or dimished. These have had a transformative effect on our justice systems, in our societies and indeed on the pan-European character of our modern continent. Europe and the world would be diminished without them. So, we should have confidence in the human rights progress from which generations have now benefitted, to defend these against undue attack, and to apply them to the new challenges we face.

Dalit, your initiative won over this audience not just because of the environmental aspect of your work, especially around the need for water, but also because of the collaboration it fosters between communities with the noble aspiration of building trust and contributing to the conditions for peace. You should be particularly proud given the high standard of this year’s competition including, of course, the original and inspiring entries from all three finalists. Clever and effective ideas like yours are more important than ever. Because as the years go by and the evidence mounts, the reality of humankind’s damage to the environment is simply too great – too urgent – to ignore. Understanding it, preventing it, and mitigating it: Each of these is vital as the clock ticks ever closer to midnight. Over the course of the last two days, this World Forum has heard from so many individuals, experts and organisations that have taken on the challenge. We have heard wonderful, original examples of what citizens and civil society organisations can do within their democracies to bring about real change on the ground. And I hope that in airing those ideas here in Strasbourg, you might be inspired to spread the word and good practice on your return home. After all, each of us has the capacity and the responsibility to make our own contribution to saving the environment, and to share the knowledge we acquire. We need not wait for a green light, but must instead move forward now and with determination. That’s true for individuals and civil society and it’s true for business and industry and governments and international organisations too. Everyone must play their part. And this surely is what sets democracies apart – That ideas, action and responsibility are not hoarded at the centre but are allowed to flourish at every level of our societies. At our best, we don’t just allow them – we encourage and nurture them too. So, I am glad that this Forum’s plenary sessions looked at what contribution we all can and should make: Whether it is national governments, international organisations or citizens that are setting the pace for change; What governing still is most effective; And what roles the public and private sectors should play. Many interesting things have been said. You have heard repeatedly about the need for trust as a basis for action: And that citizens, the public sector and public institutions must work hand in hand. One speaker suggested that only democracy can save the environment; And that perhaps saving the environment will save democracy too - By proving its effectiveness and bolstering trust at a time when many are out to undermine it. There was also a very interesting plenary session this morning on the role of multilateral organisations. This is particularly relevant to us here at the Council of Europe. Our Organisation exists to protect and promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law among our 47 member states and the 840 million people who live in them. Where damage to the environment threatens the standards we set, our job is to act. The European Convention on Human Rights is clear about the rights to life, to respect for private and family life and to the protection of property. Where environmental harm has threatened these, the European Court of Human Rights has been clear that governments must act – and its judgments are legally binding. And more such cases will likely be brought to Strasbourg.

On 10 December 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted a catalogue of fundamental rights which apply equally to all individuals – regardless of their skin colour, gender, religion, national or social origin. This was a real milestone for the protection of human rights. The founding states of the Council of Europe followed this example when they signed the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. After two world wars and the horrific crimes of the Holocaust, the Convention signalled the birth of a better Europe in which human rights would come first. We have accomplished much since then. Yet these great achievements must be defended time and again: not only on Human Rights Day but at all times and in all places. As the guardian of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the Council of Europe has established itself as Europe’s moral compass and conscience. With its binding international conventions, it sets standards unparalleled in the world. For 835 million citizens, the European Court of Human Rights is the final court of appeal when they feel that their rights have been violated. On 18 November, Germany assumed the Presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for six months. During the last few months, protecting the rule of law and human rights has also been among the priorities of Germany’s Presidency of the Council of the EU. For example, a new rule of law review mechanism was established under the German Presidency, a frank dialogue on the state of the rule of law in all member states based on the European Commission’s Rule of Law Report. The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe has contributed key expertise to this. Any successful human rights policy has to keep pace with new developments. Technological advances can have a positive impact on our future path. But they bring with them risks such as discrimination and inequality resulting from artificial intelligence. They also apply in the digital world. For the internet is not a space outside the law. We cannot allow hate and incitement to hatred to destroy the open culture of debate in our democratic, pluralistic society. How robust a democracy is and how well it functions can be measured not least by its ability to safeguard the rights of minorities. Protecting certain groups is not clientelism but part of our shared identity. Diversity has made Europe what it is today. We should therefore never slacken our efforts to protect those who suffer most from marginalisation and discrimination, be they LGBTIQ persons, Roma, migrants or refugees. We want everyone in Europe to have the right to be different without being fearful. That applies especially in the current pandemic, which has hit the most vulnerable and those in most need in our society hardest, and during which fundamental rights have been temporarily restricted throughout Europe. For cohesion in Europe it is important that we now act together and in a spirit of solidarity. This begins with small gestures and ends with issues such as the fair distribution of vaccines or the protection of groups at particular risk. We are very concerned by the marked rise in violence against women and children during the pandemic. Financial hardship, fears about job security and curfews have resulted in ever more women being subjected to violence in their own homes. The Istanbul Convention provides an effective instrument for counteracting this development. However, the Convention has still not been ratified by all member states of the Council of Europe. We will seek to get these countries on board. Today, Europe provides the highest level of human rights protection in the world – not least thanks to the Council of Europe. However, the pandemic has also highlighted the areas where we still have to enhance the protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The motto of this year’s Human Rights Day is “Recover Better – Stand Up for Human Rights”. Recovery in the wake of the pandemic will offer us a great opportunity to make a fresh start with stronger human rights.

Guidance notes are issued as a means to update our states parties and to rejuvenate the Convention. In July, for example, a Guidance Note on Electoral Interference was adopted by the Cybercrime Convention Committee. Its purpose is to show how the Convention can be used to prosecute malicious cyberattacks against an activity that is essential to democracy: holding elections. Capacity-building activities and implementation assessments by our Cybercrime Convention Committee also reinforce the Convention’s effectiveness. Indeed, these are essential. Technical assistance to strengthen legislation; training for investigators, prosecutors and judges; and co-operation between the public and private sectors and at the international level are all required. Capacity building can also build bridges and create trust even where there are controversies on the rules governing the Internet. And we do this capacity-building through our Cybercrime Programme Office in Bucharest. In the past twelve months alone, this Office has supported 240 activities involving more than 120 countries, all of which have met our prerequisite of committing to national legislation in line with Budapest Convention standards. This work has involved joint projects including with the European Union. And I want to thank all of those partners and donors that have made funding available, including Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Their support has made a big difference. So, what we have here are common and evolving standards, specialist Committee-led assessments and follow-up, and capacity-building expertise that have all been forged by 18 years of operational experience. This dynamic triangle has sustained a criminal justice response that meets our human rights and rule of law requirements. And there is little doubt that the Budapest Convention will remain the most relevant international standard in the years to come. But I began this afternoon by pointing out that we need to do more and become more effective to address fast-evolving and escalating cybercrime. The Parties to the Budapest Convention have been discussing for some years how to better address the new challenges that have emerged and which relate to cloud computing and jurisdiction in cyberspace. In 2017, this resulted in the Cybercrime Convention Committee starting to prepare a new Protocol, which is due to be finalised by the end of 2020. Its aim is to provide innovative solutions to secure electronic evidence more efficiently in line with data protection and rule of law safeguards. Because if we do not ensure an effective criminal justice response, there is every likelihood that cybercrime will be dealt with increasingly in the national security arena. This is less transparent, and often results in fewer protections for individuals’ rights. And at this Conference, you will have the opportunity to engage in consultations on the draft text of our Protocol. We need your experience and insights to help us ensure that we get the balance of the text right. Octopus Conferences on cybercrime over the past
15 years have helped to shape the international criminal justice response to cybercrime. So let us use this occasion to once again come up with solutions that will make a real difference.

These thirty cartoons deploy skill, wit and imagination to represent what human rights mean and the complexities and impediments that too often prevent them from being realised. I congratulate our Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovic, the French Presidency of our Committee of Ministers and the artists and organisers themselves for their respective roles in ensuring this display. It constitutes an important part of the autumn initiative by Cartooning for Peace to turn Strasbourg, the capital of Europe, into Strasbourg, the capital of cartoons. And I am very happy this will include a Carte Blanche session at our World Forum for Democracy on the afternoon of 7th November, where press cartoonists will discuss and draw. This will be followed the next morning by a plenary session on the Freedom of Expression and Protection of Journalists - with Plantu himself as a speaker. And throughout the course of the three-day Forum, the cartoonists will collaborate on the production of a multi-panelled fresco, and illustrate each of the plenaries with live drawings. But in the meantime, I again congratulate everyone involved in this imaginative and important exhibition and I encourage you to take a close look at all of the works on display. I am confident that they will spark the creativity within each of us too.

Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank the Russian authorities for this timely opportunity to discuss ways of addressing the Covid-19 crisis. The challenges it poses are numerous. Of these, the danger to human life is the most urgent and we must do what we can to save as many people as possible. But we must also act to mitigate other, and longer-term, implications. The Council of Europe was founded in order to bring peace to Europe after two devastating world wars. We do this by establishing better understanding and greater unity throughout our continent: by promoting
co-operation and assistance among our member states to resolve common problems. This is the main lesson learned from the Great Victory, whose 75th anniversary we will mark next month. Human rights, democracy, and the rule of law are the shared values that underpin the Council of Europe’s work. And we uphold these by means of its treaties and mechanisms, forming a unique legal space from Vladivostok to Lisbon, with the European Convention on Human Rights at its core. Our common legal standards are of great relevance during this current crisis. Some core rights enshrined in the European Convention are not to subject to any derogation. Others may be restricted, but only in a lawful and proportionate manner. And we have just released guidelines to assist our member states in achieving that balance as they struggle with the current public emergency. Because, while the virus is resulting in the tragic loss of life, we must nonetheless prevent it from destroying our way of life - our understanding of who we are, what we value, and the rights to which every European is entitled. Foremost in our minds now are the rights to health and to equitable access to health care. Both are set out in our conventions and often guaranteed, albeit in general terms, by national Constitutions. We had considered that these rights were safe in Europe today. But health systems in the most affected states have proven unprepared to respond to the emergency as we might have expected. So we should look to employ our international mechanisms – the European Social Charter, the Moscow Convention on Medicrime and the Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, as well as the European Pharmacopeia – to review and strengthen states’ capacities to comply with our common standards. We are ready to assist them in this regard. But we must also turn our attention to the situation facing vulnerable groups. These include the gravely ill, people in extreme hardship, the elderly, and those deprived of their liberty, including many migrants. Inadequate health care may impact some of these people so severely that they fall within the scope of “inhuman and degrading treatment”, as the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture warned at the very beginning of this crisis. The Council of Europe must therefore enhance its legal tools and co-operation programmes in order to prevent and remedy what might be defined as ill-treatment. We will also revisit our action on social cohesion and youth policy so as to spread best practices for the benefit of those in greatest need. This brings me to another important point. The Council of Europe’s role and approach on economic and social rights needs to be reviewed as Europe enters what is also clearly an economic crisis. The full impact on business, jobs and prosperity cannot be known at this stage, but it will be significant, not least for small and medium enterprises. Unemployment has already risen exponentially in many European countries that were considered wealthy and safe only weeks ago. And we know that financial precariousness can lead to heightened vulnerability and social disruption. We must therefore continue to work with our member states with a view to strengthening our mechanisms for the protection of social rights. The last decade focused on the successful reform of the mechanism of the European Convention on Human Rights. As a result, the European Court of Human Rights has become more efficient and more effective. We now need to give as much attention to the European system of social rights protection. Collective engagement and solidarity are what we need Europe-wide – and the Council of Europe will spare no effort assisting our member states in this respect. We must also do everything possible to ensure that the epidemic does not lead to a weakening of the democratic foundations on which our civil and political rights and our freedoms rely. Freedom of expression should be preserved, and any restrictions must be strictly proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public health. This applies equally to freedom of conscience, freedom of association and the right to privacy. Of course, the pandemic creates an extraordinary situation in our political life. Civil and political rights remain in place but, objectively, there are obstacles to exercising some of them fully. For example, in holding elections and referendums. We have seen that the French government has had to postpone the second round of local elections. Similarly, Armenia’s constitutional referendum has been postponed and the same thing has happened in the Russian Federation. Concerning the proposed changes to the Russian constitution, the Council of Europe has been following closely the internal debate within the country. And our Parliamentary Assembly requested an opinion from the Venice Commission on the draft amendments relating specifically to the implementation of decisions by international bodies. There are other parts of the reform that might also benefit from the input and expertise of the Council of Europe. That is why I have initiated a dialogue with the Russian authorities - so that we can progress further in our discussion on the reform - and I hope that this will be beneficial for Russia. My last point concerns the crucial importance of access to official information and documents. Freedom of expression is not the only condition for public scrutiny. An informed public debate also requires access to official information and documents that guide the
decision-making process. Whatever remedies or preventive measures are being considered during the crisis or after it, people must have information, and they must have a say. We recently enhanced our work to promote public debate on the human-rights impact of biomedical developments and on the ways to make such debate effective and meaningful. And we will go on to support an informed debate on other aspects of the current crisis and its consequences. Whether they access information first hand, or through the work of journalists and others, the public must have access to information in order to foster trust. Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Solidarity is essential as we face the current crisis. Europe, and indeed the wider world, have already been heavily affected, and the risk of further disruption is real. States are doing their best to protect their citizens, but unilateral actions have limits. So, there is an urgent need to co-ordinate states’ responses, to exchange good practice, and to help each other in the quest for a quicker recovery. The Council of Europe was created 70 years ago to achieve “a greater unity between its members”: to rebuild Europe on the basis of common values and standards and through mechanisms that allow for mutual help and support. Had it not been created then, we would have to create it today. Let us exploit what we have to its full potential.
