Address by the President of the Russian Federation	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/67828	February 21, 2022, 22:35	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends, My address concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us, for Russia. Of course, my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine. The matter is very serious and needs to be discussed in depth. The situation in Donbass has reached a critical, acute stage. I am speaking to you directly today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps. I would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties. Since time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case before the 17th century, when a portion of this territory rejoined the Russian state, and after. It seems to us that, generally speaking, we all know these facts, that this is common knowledge. Still, it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history of this issue in order to understand what is happening today, to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve. So, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia – by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought. Then, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed. But now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak. I will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is, giving the republics – the future administrative and territorial entities – broad powers upon joining a unified state. Lenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called “independents” at that time. Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession, were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after Lenin’s death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution. This immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units – the union republics – vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia. Moreover, these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions? At first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country. When it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Of course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood. I am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect. This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin’s harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine. And today the “grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it decommunization. You want decommunization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine. Going back to history, I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation. They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition. It is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s dictatorship, the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party’s monopoly on power, nationalisation and the planned economy – all this transformed the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere declaration. In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights, none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state. In fact, what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin’s but his own principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents, to the Constitution, and he did not formally revise Lenin’s principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it, there seemed to be no need for that, because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime, and outwardly it looked wonderful, attractive and even super-democratic. And yet, it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any normal state. As it often happened in our country before, nobody gave any thought to the future. It seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic issue for good. But falsification, misconception, and tampering with public opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us, and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said, the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union. In the mid-1980s, the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but primarily the growing appetites of the local elites. However, instead of analysing the situation, taking appropriate measures, first of all in the economy, and gradually transforming the political system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner, the Communist Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination. Moreover, in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself, each of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base, started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments, manipulating them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright future based either on a market or a planned economy, but amid a true impoverishment of people and widespread shortages, no one among the powers that be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country. Next, they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within their own party ranks. But in so doing, they forgot that the CPSU no longer had – thank God – the tools for retaining power and the country itself, tools such as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship, and that the notorious guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace, like a morning mist, right before their eyes. And then, the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved a truly fatal document, the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions, the CPSU platform. It included the following provisions, I quote: “The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states.” The next point: “The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s resolutions and directives in their territory.” And finally: “Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own, which shall apply to all of its residents.” Wasn’t it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to? Now is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law, or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation? The facts remain. Even two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was actually predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership, mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience. Despite all these injustices, lies and outright pillage of Russia, it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR, and recognised the new independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries, but helped its CIS partners, even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty. According to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion. However, there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991, the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially, there was this idea that all former Soviet republics will pay back these loans together, in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However, Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process in 2017. In exchange for that, the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However, Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury, gold reserves, as well as former USSR property and other assets abroad. Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields. Thus, in 2011, bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019, that is before the pandemic, Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator. At the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations. The officials in Kiev replaced partnership with a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally stole gas. I can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities – I would like to emphasise this – began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia. A role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority. It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people. Essentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia. Some industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning. Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they coveted, these people immediately betrayed their voters, going back on their election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies – the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities, and that, unlike the radicals, they would not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments. Meanwhile, the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes. A stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans. Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power. Radical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest, escalating it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign states. According to reports, the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition, large amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders’ bank accounts, tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered, the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how much did they get in the end? Better not ask. The nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution, a real terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians, journalists, and public activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities, including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished, and no one is even looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them to justice. Maidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later, the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis. According to international organisations, in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians – I emphasise – about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing: since 2020, over 60,000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid the pandemic. Since 2014, water bills increased by almost a third, and energy bills grew several times, while the price of gas for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive. What happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue, among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors including machine building, instrument engineering, electronics, ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies. In 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. Antonov, the famous manufacturer, has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016, while Yuzhmash, a factory specialising in missile and space equipment, is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This sad list goes on and on. As for the gas transportation system, it was built in its entirety by the Soviet Union, and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment. This situation begs the question: poverty, lack of opportunity, and lost industrial and technological potential – is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises of heavenly pastures? It all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens, while Ukraine itself was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority. There is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities, at the West’s demand, delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial bodies, the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges, to international organisations. In addition, the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating efforts against corruption. All right, but where are the results? Corruption is flourishing like never before. Are the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result, the government, which designates itself as the “power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty. The policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills, and the law on the so-called indigenous people has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine. Under the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language, the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces, even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants. There are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries, foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television channels, other media outlets and even members of parliament. Kiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights. Moreover, new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada. A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services. In March 2021, a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground movement in Russia’s Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists, “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,” as well as – listen carefully, please – “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.” In fact, this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia. As we know, it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons, and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons, including aircraft, as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era. In other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule this out either. If Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger, all the more so since, let me repeat, Ukraine’s Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014, the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months, there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, ostentatiously, with the entire world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed forces and special services and we are well aware of this. Over the past few years, military contingents of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian armed forces, even to their separate units and squads. The United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously anti-Russian. Last year alone, over 23,000 troops and more than a thousand units of hardware were involved. A law has already been adopted that allows foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills. Understandably, these are primarily NATO troops. This year, at least ten of these joint drills are planned. Obviously, such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine’s airspace is open to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian territory. I will add that the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships, including the use of precision weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast. At one time, the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this. I would like to repeat that today such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18th century, soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage, it became part of Russia. Also in the 18th century, the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia). Now attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea. A monument to Alexander Suvorov was recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well, in this case, be consistent. Next, notably, Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However, as it turns out, this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented. Ukraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it. Kiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed, each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into military alliances. There would be no problem with that, if it were not for one “but.” International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana Declaration. In other words, the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should not pose a threat to other states, whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat to Russia's security. Let me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008, the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, by the way, Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then, but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy. A number of NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining NATO. We are getting signals from some European capitals telling us not to worry since it will not happen literally overnight. In fact, our US partners are saying the same thing as well. “All right, then” we respond, “if it does not happen tomorrow, then it will happen the day after tomorrow. What does it change from the historical perspective? Nothing at all.” Furthermore, we are aware of the US leadership’s position and words that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption. All the while, they are trying to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia. Again, they want us to take their word for it. But we are well aware of the real value of these words. In 1990, when German unification was discussed, the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction or military presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east. This is a quote. They issued lots of verbal assurances, all of which turned out to be empty phrases. Later, they began to assure us that the accession to NATO by Central and Eastern European countries would only improve relations with Moscow, relieve these countries of the fears steeped in their bitter historical legacy, and even create a belt of countries that are friendly towards Russia. However, the exact opposite happened. The governments of certain Eastern European countries, speculating on Russophobia, brought their complexes and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building up the collective defence potentials and deploying them primarily against Russia. Worse still, that happened in the 1990s and the early 2000s when, thanks to our openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached a high level. Russia has fulfilled all of its obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from Central and Eastern Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming the legacy of the Cold War. We have consistently proposed various cooperation options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats. Moreover, I will say something I have never said publicly, I will say it now for the first time. When then outgoing US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow in 2000, I asked him how America would feel about admitting Russia to NATO. I will not reveal all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my question was, let us say, quite restrained, and the Americans’ true attitude to that possibility can actually be seen from their subsequent steps with regard to our country. I am referring to the overt support for terrorists in the North Caucasus, the disregard for our security demands and concerns, NATO’s continued expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so on. It raises the question: why? What is all this about, what is the purpose? All right, you do not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy? There can be only one answer – this is not about our political regime or anything like that. They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around. This is the answer to all questions. This is the source of America’s traditional policy towards Russia. Hence the attitude to all our security proposals Today, one glance at the map is enough to see to what extent Western countries have kept their promise to refrain from NATO’s eastward expansion. They just cheated. We have seen five waves of NATO expansion, one after another – Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020. As a result, the Alliance, its military infrastructure has reached Russia’s borders. This is one of the key causes of the European security crisis; it has had the most negative impact on the entire system of international relations and led to the loss of mutual trust. The situation continues to deteriorate, including in the strategic area. Thus, positioning areas for interceptor missiles are being established in Romania and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system. It is common knowledge that the launchers deployed there can be used for Tomahawk cruise missiles – offensive strike systems. In addition, the United States is developing its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface targets. In other words, the allegedly defensive US missile defence system is developing and expanding its new offensive capabilities. The information we have gives us good reason to believe that Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time. We clearly understand that given this scenario, the level of military threats to Russia will increase dramatically, several times over. And I would like to emphasise at this point that the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply. I will explain that American strategic planning documents confirm the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy missile systems. We also know the main adversary of the United States and NATO. It is Russia. NATO documents officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike. If our ancestors heard about this, they would probably simply not believe this. We do not want to believe this today either, but it is what it is. I would like people in Russia and Ukraine to understand this. Many Ukrainian airfields are located not far from our borders. NATO’s tactical aviation deployed there, including precision weapon carriers, will be capable of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan line. The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace up to the Urals. Finally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary. Of course, they are going to behave in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb: “The dogs bark but the caravan goes on.” Let me say right away – we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table. We are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008, Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However, our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities. Furthermore, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees. Last December, we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member states. The United States and NATO responded with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray. We responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided, however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia’s core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed. These principled proposals of ours have been ignored. To reiterate, our Western partners have once again vocalised the all-too-familiar formulas that each state is entitled to freely choose ways to ensure its security or to join any military union or alliance. That is, nothing has changed in their stance, and we keep hearing the same old references to NATO’s notorious “open door” policy. Moreover, they are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions, which, by the way, they will introduce no matter what as Russia continues to strengthen its sovereignty and its Armed Forces. To be sure, they will never think twice before coming up with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack regardless of the developments in Ukraine. Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia. And they will keep doing so, just as they did before, even without any formal pretext just because we exist and will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests or values. I would like to be clear and straightforward: in the current circumstances, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country has increased significantly, Russia has every right to respond in order to ensure its security. That is exactly what we will do. With regard to the state of affairs in Donbass, we see that the ruling Kiev elites never stop publicly making clear their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, they are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass as was the case in 2014 and 2015. We all know how these reckless schemes ended. Not a single day goes by without Donbass communities coming under shelling attacks. The recently formed large military force makes use of attack drones, heavy equipment, missiles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women and the elderly, continues unabated. As we say, there is no end in sight to this. Meanwhile, the so-called civilised world, which our Western colleagues proclaimed themselves the only representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if this horror and genocide, which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist. But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national policy. They are fighting for their elementary right to live on their own land, to speak their own language, and to preserve their culture and traditions. How long can this tragedy continue? How much longer can one put up with this? Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All these years, it has persistently and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to settle the situation in Donbass. Everything was in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies come and go, but deep down the aggressive and nationalistic regime that seized power in Kiev remains unchanged. It is entirely a product of the 2014 coup, and those who then embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one. In this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision and to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. I would like to ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision and then ratify the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with both republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed shortly. We want those who seized and continue to hold power in Kiev to immediately stop hostilities. Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will lie entirely on the conscience of Ukraine’s ruling regime. As I announce the decisions taken today, I remain confident in the support of Russia’s citizens and the country’s patriotic forces. Thank you.

Vladimir Putin congratulated Moscow residents on City Day	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/75054	September 7, 2024, 12:45	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International The President took part in a gala event at the Zaryadye Concert Hall on the occasion of the 877th anniversary of the foundation of Moscow. Address on Moscow City Day President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Sobyanin Sobyanin SergeiMoscow Mayor , friends, As always, we mark a wonderful holiday – Moscow City Day – at the very beginning of autumn. I wish Muscovites and, of course, everyone in our vast country a happy holiday, because each one of us, wherever we were born and raised, has special feelings for the capital of our Fatherland. The golden-domed and majestic Moscow has remained the heart of Russia. It is a hero city and a worker city, the focal point of our multi-ethnic people’s value code, the symbol and reliable stronghold of our statehood. Muscovites have always, especially during the most difficult periods in our history, felt responsible for the Motherland, performed labour and military feats, preserved our unique cultural values, and set a fine example of courage, fortitude and love for the Motherland. Today, together with residents from all Russian regions, thousands of Muscovites are fighting on the front lines of the special military operation. The capital is supporting Donetsk, Lugansk, and our border regions. I would also like to address the employees of Moscow industrial enterprises. Within a short period of time, you have multiplied your output for the needs of the special military operation and, in general, for strengthening the country’s security and technological sovereignty. Moscow has become the most important centre for the development of unmanned systems technology and the largest producer of critically important pharmaceuticals. The construction of advanced enterprises in microelectronics and photonics and other high-tech fields is in full swing. Moreover, the capital has emphasised the development of innovative and environmentally friendly production facilities. Building new facilities, along with upgrading existing ones, has provided impressive results in the truest sense of the word. Thus, in a matter of five years, industrial output in the capital’s manufacturing industries has grown by 2.5 times, and the growth rate was maintained at a very high level of 20 percent in the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year. To enable young Muscovites to make a successful career at the capital’s factories and engineering centres, Moscow is rapidly improving the quality and expanding opportunities for vocational education. Existing workshops and laboratories are being renovated and new ones created, the content of educational programmes is being updated, and the accessibility of training is expanding. This year, for example, 16,000 additional state-funded places were made available at Moscow colleges to 9th grade graduates. In other words, it was possible to enter almost every field of study without enrolment competition. Let me add that the Moscow authorities have been working with the federal Government. Together, they have recently completed the most ambitious and grand project in higher professional education by building and launching new buildings for the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, one of Russia’s leading technical universities, to mark the start of a new academic year. I am certain that the legendary Bauman University will benefit from this state-of-the-art university campus as it strives to expand its capabilities in terms of training engineers, undertaking research projects and working on advanced technology. As for the youth energy and creativity – they will keep inspiring Moscow, helping it move forward and build a track record of success today, and for the future. Friends, Moscow is, of course, one of the world’s best metropolitan cities, and we have every right to affirm this. This applies to the quality of life it offers, as well as the way it enables its residents to unlock their talent and potential. Moscow is home to innovative manufacturing facilities, research and educational centres, which exist side by side and in harmony with unique museums, concert halls, as well as our sacred spiritual and historical sites. People in and outside Russia have been praising Moscow for its openness and hospitality. Last year, 24.5 million Russian and international tourists visited our capital city. I have no doubt that there will be even more people who will want to travel to Moscow and marvel at its beauty and its landmarks, especially considering that people can use almost all the available transport means to get here. In this context, let me note that the project to build the M-12 motorway continues. It will connect central Russia with the regions along the Volga. Soon, it will reach the Urals, and will then continue into Siberia and Russia’s Far East. As you know, we have launched the construction of a high-speed railway linking Moscow to St Petersburg. In Moscow, the metro network has almost doubled over the past 14 years. Today, on City Day, several stations opened all at once along Line 16, the Troitskaya Line. Not only is Moscow famous for its cutting-edge transport infrastructure, but also for its well-tended, clean streets and its parks with all their amenities and improvements. Of course, I rarely get to enjoy all this beauty, but I do visit these places occasionally. We have every right to be proud of what we see in Moscow, and you all know this. Sports arenas and fitness courts have become Moscow’s hallmarks, along with all kinds of amateur sports competitions, marathons and spartakiades. The city government pays special attention to promoting mass sport and, of course, improving the health of Moscow residents is a major priority too. All the hospital buildings in Kommunarka have been completed and launched. Mr Sobyanin and I have been there to inspect all these premises not that long ago, or so it might seem. It was during the pandemic. I remember the way he pointed his finger all around him, saying that there will one building here, and another one there. And they delivered on all these undertakings. The programme to upgrade and renovate outpatient clinics is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. The same timeline applies to the project to build a therapy building at the St Vladimir Children’s Hospital. It will benefit from state-of-the-art equipment and will be one of the best and biggest facilities of this kind in Russia. We will make sure to use the best practices developed in Moscow to improve the way medical institutions across Russia work. Friends, Moscow has been impressing us with the way it has been developing, in terms of both pace and quality-wise. The city is changing rapidly. Moscow residents are the ones who must be recognised for these outcomes, above anything else. I would like to thank you from all my heart for your dedication and devotion to your home city and to our great Motherland. The people of Moscow always pursue new goals and get more things done. This is why the city has such an ambitious development programme in terms of its aspirations and designs. It traces a path forward for many years to come. I am certain that Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and his team, with the support of the people of Moscow, which is an essential and instrumental factor when undertaking efforts of this kind, will deliver on all these plans. I wish you new achievements, good health, and all the best. Happy City Day!

Address to participants in the Second Russia-Uzbekistan Interregional Cooperation Forum	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/67118	November 17, 2021, 15:20	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, I am delighted to welcome the participants in the Second Russia-Uzbekistan Interregional Cooperation Forum. I believe in the importance of this bilateral framework and its relevance not only for promoting region-to-region ties between the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan, but also for strengthening our strategic partnership, which stands out for its intensity and vibrancy, and is truly multifaceted. Russia is one of Uzbekistan’s leading trading partners, ranking second in its foreign trade. Even during the pandemic, our economic ties continued to expand. In 2020, trade increased by 16 percent almost reaching US$6 billion, and in the first nine months of 2021 it grew by more than 6 percent. This is largely attributable to region-to-region cooperation. Russian regions that are proactive in maintaining economic ties with their partners in Uzbekistan include Moscow, St Petersburg, Tatarstan, as well as the Chelyabinsk, Moscow, Ivanovo and Samara regions. The construction of the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant and the Kandym Gas Processing Complex, as well as the launch in Uzbekistan of harvester production with Rostselmash’s participation are all examples of mutually beneficial cooperation in recent years. Russia is one of the main investors in Uzbekistan’s economy with over 150 joint projects currently underway worth over US$14 billion. The number of ventures with Russian capital increased 2.5 times over the past four years to exceed 2,000 entities. Let me note, in particular, the INNOPROM. Big Industrial Week in Uzbekistan exhibition. It took place in April 2021 with the participation of 13 Russian regions and resulted in the signing of 21 agreements worth some US$130 million. Of course, we welcome the interest expressed by our friends in Uzbekistan in stepping up their ties with their Russian partners, which is demonstrated by the fact that over the past two months delegations from Uzbekistan visited 20 Russian regions. This kind of cooperation has far from depleted its potential. There are many opportunities for undertaking new direct cooperation projects, creating value chains in manufacturing, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and innovative technology. By playing a more proactive role within the Eurasian Economic Union our partners in Uzbekistan could further strengthen our cooperation. In late 2020, Uzbekistan became an observer in our integration structure, and we are certain that this will benefit Uzbekistan and all EAEU member states. Of course, region-to-region ties are not just about the economy or trade. We have built a solid record of accomplishments in working together on protecting the environment, water resources and forests, as well as biodiversity and conservation areas. We are carrying out joint projects for addressing the urgent environmental problems of the Aral Sea and facilitating socioeconomic development in the entire Aral Sea region. Russia and Uzbekistan are proactive in promoting their humanitarian ties, as well as stepping up their academic, educational and youth exchanges. The Second Russia-Uzbekistan Educational Forum, currently taking place at Lomonosov Moscow State University, will discuss these and many other important matters. By the way, Russian universities have 14 branches and representative offices in Uzbekistan. This number will increase to 16 next year. St Petersburg State University will open its branch in Tashkent. A number of other projects to improve Russian language teaching in Uzbekistan’s kindergartens and schools are underway. To conclude, I strongly believe that the Regional Forum will make a tangible contribution to further promoting the strategic partnership and allied relations between Russia and Uzbekistan and strengthen our neighbourly and mutually beneficial ties for the benefit of our peoples. I would like to thank the organisers and all the participants in this forum and wish them every success. Thank you for your attention.

Ceremonial review of the 104th Guards Airborne Regiment of the Pskov Guards Air Assault Division	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/62892	March 1, 2020, 16:20	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International As part of the commemorative events in honour of the paratroopers who heroically died 20 years ago, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief conducted a ceremonial review of the personnel of the 104th Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Guards Airborne Regiment of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. This division is the oldest of the Airborne Troops’ existing units. From 1999 to 2004 its personnel took part in the Second Chechen War. In 2000, the paratroopers of the 6th Company of the 104th Airborne Regiment displayed great heroism during a battle with armed rebel groups. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, sergeants and soldiers, Today, here, on this parade square, which was so familiar to the 6th Company, we remember the brave paratroopers and salute their courage and feats. They stood in the way of hundreds of militants and fought their last fight, their final battle as real heroes, remaining loyal to the best traditions of their brothers in arms, which are cherished by all generations of paratroopers. The “airborne infantry” is always deployed to areas of great danger and challenges, where there is difficulty and risk, where powerful, swift and precise strikes are needed. The history of the Airborne Troops is full of legendary examples of bravery, military training and unstoppable determination. The 104th Regiment, its soldiers and officers, wrote their own bright pages of military valour, displaying many times their highest professionalism and never sparing themselves, in training or in battle. Our people are proud of you and believe that you will continue to resolutely defend the interests of Russia, protect its safety and the lives of our people. If necessary, you will continue to fight off adversaries the way it was done by your comrades, who will eternally remain your fellow soldiers, the paratroopers of the 6th Company. Thank you for your service!

Gala evening marking the 100th anniversary of Russian civil aviation	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/70485	February 9, 2023, 19:50	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International A gala evening was hosted in the State Kremlin Palace to mark the 100th anniversary of Russian civil aviation, during which Vladimir Putin presented Russian Federation state decorations to industry representatives. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Friends, veterans, Today we are marking an important milestone: the 100th anniversary of Russian civil aviation. I congratulate you, everyone present in this hall and your colleagues, everyone for whom working in this strategic industry has become not just a job, but a vocation and destiny. Russian civil aviation has always been a symbol of technological progress. Its creation and rapid development served as a powerful boost for science and technology, industrial production and the education system. We can be justly proud of the glorious history of civil aviation and the civil air fleet. Thanks to the work and talent of outstanding designers such as Antonov, Tupolev, Ilyushin, Yakovlev and many others, a wide range of domestic aviation equipment was created and used to set many world records for speed, range, and duration of flights. The courage of the civil aviation pilots who rescued a polar expedition aboard the Chelyuskin steamer from ice captivity in 1934 and were the first to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union will forever be remembered by Russians. And three years later, the first non-stop flight to the United States via the North Pole of the crew under the command of Valery Chkalov became a real feat. It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of the civil air fleet to the development of our country. Without it, it is impossible to imagine the achievements of industrialisation, the development of Siberia, the Far East, the Arctic and the Great Victory in 1945. We will not forget the heroism of the People’s Defence Commissariat aviation groups, which were made up of civil aviation pilots. In the most difficult conditions, they supplied the front and partisan squads, besieged Leningrad, and the defenders of Sevastopol and Stalingrad with ammunition, medicine, and food, as well as evacuated the wounded under fire. And in the victorious May of 1945, the pilots of the 10th Guards Air Transport Division delivered the Act of Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender to Vnukovo. In the post-war decades, Aeroflot connected almost all major Soviet cities with foreign capitals. It began carrying millions of passengers, thereby enhancing the status of our country as one of the world’s leading aviation powers. During the hard times of 1990s, civil aviation managed to overcome the difficulties and take its place in the new market economy. Step by step, it confidently propelled itself to a growth trajectory. Friends, Today, civil aviation retains its special, strategic importance. It plays a key role in the steady development of our enormous country and in ensuring connectivity between our regions. It facilitates the dynamic growth of many high-tech industries. Today, civil aviation is 225 airports, including 80 international airports, more than a hundred airlines, and 18 institutions of higher and secondary vocational education, as well as other organisations. A total of almost 200,000 specialists work in these structures – in your structures – who professionally resolve the most complex and responsible tasks. As for civil aviation’s achievements in the past decade, I would like to note the quality service during the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the World Cup and other landmark, global events. The Unified Air Traffic Management System has been upgraded and the regional centres streamlined – we talked about this earlier. Even during the practically total suspension of international flights due to the coronavirus pandemic, domestic civil aviation maintained its position and ensured the continuity of its development. Thus, even in a difficult, uneasy 2022, Russian companies carried over 95 million passengers overall. In conditions of unprecedented sanctions against our country, civil aviation was one of the first to be hit. However, it efficiently took on this challenge and has resolved the arising problems in a system-wide and consistent manner. We just met with your colleagues today – the workers and veterans of civil aviation. We discussed with them, in part, measures of state support for the industry. In the past year alone, the federal budget allocated over 174 billion rubles for this purpose. This made it possible for companies to retain their employees, preserve their unique experience and competences, and focus on the development agenda. Notably, 84 airfields have been upgraded and eight new regional and hub airports have been built over the past 20 years. New Russian aircraft are being designed and promising, logistically optimised routes are being developed. This work will continue. Airports will be retrofitted. The number of direct flights and modern transport hubs will increase. Special attention will be paid to renewing the airline fleet. As I noted earlier, we will address these challenges relying on domestic technology and the capacities of domestic manufacturers. We will create and develop a range of new and upgraded aircraft and localise production as much as possible. In addition, to support airlines, a new mechanism for easy-term leasing of domestic aircraft is about to go live and will be funded from the National Welfare Fund. This will boost the efficiency of aircraft operation, which will ultimately improve availability of air transport. We will continue to subsidise tickets for socially important destinations, as well as fares for pensioners, people with disabilities, students, and families with many children. Also, budget funding to expand air ambulance service for residents of remote areas will more than double this year, which will raise the standard and availability of medical care. To reiterate, our goal is to make the industry competitive, modern, and responsive to current demands and national development goals. I am confident that the people working in the industry will make every effort to effectively address the challenges they are facing. We are well aware of the fact that steady operation of the industry relies primarily on honest work and coordinated efforts of pilots, engineers and air traffic controllers, as well as flight attendants and many other industry professionals. I would like to thank everyone working in the field of civil aviation for their competence and reliability and for acting in an organised, efficient and professional manner in all, sometimes even emergency, situations. Warm words of gratitude are reserved for veterans of the civil aviation industry, people who devoted their lives to their career of choice and worked honestly and responsibly for the good of the Motherland, and who honoured and built on the industry’s traditions. Once again, happy anniversary and happy holiday. <…> Vladimir Putin: Friends, Once again, congratulations to all of you. You can see how many anniversaries there are: now we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the industry as a whole, and then the 100th anniversary of Aeroflot. One of the award winners [Oleg Zaika – Senior Pilot Instructor, S7 Airlines] just said that soon he will mark 100 years of his family’s flight experience [of Zaika's aviation dynasty], which, of course, is also an outstanding achievement. I think that the industry should also celebrate such events, and this will certainly be done. He also said that they would envy us. They already envy us, otherwise they would not bother us – that is the whole point. But let them practice, and we will only strengthen ourselves inside and out, also thanks to your work. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the 100th anniversary of civil aviation! Good luck!

Greetings on National Guard Day	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/63068	March 27, 2020, 09:00	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, veterans, Please accept my best wishes on your professional holiday, National Guard Day. Thank you for your service, for the impeccable accomplishment of the complicated and responsible missions set to the Russian National Guard, such as the fight against terrorism and extremism, reliable control of arms sales and the protection of the main state facilities, infrastructure and cargo. One more responsibility that calls for your special attention and mobilisation is maintaining law and order as well as public safety during public, political, sports and cultural events. In all of these cases you are required to act resolutely and effectively, as well as, which I would like to emphasise, in strict accordance with the law, giving priority attention to the rights and interests of our citizens and based on their trust and respect. I know that the men and officers of the Russian National Guard are proud of their glorious history and uphold their combat traditions, fulfilling their orders honourably and in full despite any difficulties and risk to their lives. I have no doubt that the National Guard will continue to act firmly, concertedly and reliably, while continuing to upgrade the training and professionalism of personnel and strengthening interaction with their colleagues from other agencies in the interests of national security and the safety of Russian citizens. I wish the military and civilian personnel of the National Guard every success, prosperity and all the best to their families and loved ones. Congratulations on the holiday once again.

Address to participants of the Conference of Heads of Prosecutor’s Offices of European States	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/66153	July 7, 2021, 10:00	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Vladimir Putin addressed the Conference of Heads of Prosecutor’s Offices of European States. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome you at the Conference of Heads of Prosecutor’s Offices of European States in St Petersburg. Despite the difference in your powers and the specifics of the national legislations, your offices are playing a major role in ensuring the priority of law in your countries, protecting civil rights and freedoms and the interests of the state and society. These basic goals and tasks not only unite you, but also highlight the importance of cooperation and meaningful professional partnership. During the next few days, you will be discussing a broad range of topics related to the role of prosecutor’s offices in the protection of civil rights in accordance with the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights. I regard this as a matter of utmost significance. People and their rights and freedoms are the greatest value, and it is the duty of the state to create effective mechanisms for their unhindered implementation. This fully concerns the social rights of citizens, including the right to affordable, high-quality medical services. This is especially important now in light of the coronavirus pandemic that spread throughout the world last year. Other items on your agenda deserve serious attention as well. They include compliance with norms and requirements of environmental security, the fight against cybercrime and efforts against illegal migration. These are common challenges for all European countries, and the effectiveness of our response to them will largely determine social stability, law and order, and the sustainable development of our states and the European continent as a whole. The Russian Prosecutor’s Office is working energetically in all these spheres. Acting as an integral centralised system, it is fulfilling all its tasks accurately and is contributing to the development of Russia as a truly law-based, socially oriented and democratic state. I would like to emphasise that these principles have been recently intensified and specified in the renewed Constitution of Russia and in the Russian legislation as a whole. Acting within the framework of their supervisory authority, prosecutors are monitoring compliance with the law throughout Russia and taking measures to protect people’s rights in case of any violations. For example, during the pandemic, the prosecutor’s offices redoubled their efforts to monitor the timely provision of medical care, medicine and social payments and also benefits. While doing this, they pay special attention to the protection of the rights of children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, large families and low-income families. I would like to point out specifically that we have recently adopted a federal law that granted new powers to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia. It has to do with representing and protecting the interests of Russia in interstate agencies, foreign and international courts, and foreign and international courts of arbitration, including the European Court of Human Rights. I mentioned this before, but I would like to say it again: Russia is interested in developing the closest possible ties with the prosecutor’s offices of European and other states, and in promoting dialogue and cooperation within the framework of respected and influential agencies, such as the Council of Europe and the International Association of Prosecutors. I am confident that such constructive interaction, including the exchange of information and the best legal practices, will help us to more reliably protect civil rights and freedoms and to succeed in the fight against common threats, including those that are connected with the rapid technological and other changes in our societies. I hope that during this conference you will adopt recommendations that will help to enhance the efficiency of prosecutors’ offices.

Launch of construction of new power units at Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/65606	May 19, 2021, 12:35	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping took part, via videoconference, in a ceremony to launch the construction of the seventh and eighth power units at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant and the third and fourth power units at the Xudapu Nuclear Power Plant in China. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping Xi JinpingPresident of People's Republic of China launched the concreting of the foundation of the seventh power unit at the Tianwan NPP and of the third power unit at the Xudapu NPP. On Russia’s side, the event was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Russian part of the Russian-Chinese Intergovernmental Commission on Energy Cooperation Alexander Novak Novak AlexanderDeputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation and Director General of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom Alexei Likhachev Likhachev AlexeiDirector General of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom . * * * President of China Xi Jinping (retranslated): President Putin, Construction workers of the China-Russia nuclear energy projects, I am really delighted to be attending together with President Putin the ceremony to mark the start of the construction of the China-Russia joint nuclear energy projects. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the people, I would like to sincerely congratulate you on this occasion and to express profound respect for the constructors of both countries. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the China-Russia Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation. President Putin and I agreed to strive for expanding and deepening bilateral relations. Against the backdrop of the pandemic and unparalleled changes over a period of the past century, our countries have been providing each other with solid support and have been engaged in close and effective cooperation. This clearly illustrates the profound meaning of China-Russia relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation in the new era. Energy has always been the biggest and most successful branch in our practical cooperation while nuclear energy cooperation has been its strategic priority. We are jointly upgrading our cooperation in this area and have already put into operation a host of major projects. Today, President Putin and I are attending the ceremony marking the launch of the construction of the seventh and eighth power units at theTianwan NPP and the third and fourth power units at the Xudapu NPP. This is yet another major achievement of our bilateral cooperation. In this context, I would just like to express a few things that are desired regarding our future cooperation. First of all, it is necessary to make safety top priority and to create an example of global nuclear energy cooperation. Safety is a vital guarantee for the nuclear industry. The sides must always focus on safety issues and set the most rigid requirements when it comes to the quality and standards of the construction and maintenance of the four power units, thereby creating a global example of nuclear safety. It is important to have a full understanding of the potential offered by our complementarity in market resources, technologies, production capacities and specialists, to promote our cooperation in the nuclear sphere, and to make a sizable contribution to the global development of nuclear energy. Second, it is necessary to strive for innovation-based development and to strengthen scientific and technical cooperation in the nuclear sphere. Using the opportunities offered by China-Russia years of scientific, technical and innovative cooperation, it is important to focus on environmental protection in the nuclear sphere, nuclear medicine, nuclear fuel and advanced technologies, to strengthen cooperation in fundamental research, in the development of key technologies and in the implementation of innovative products in the manufacturing processes, to promote the use of the latest digital technologies in the nuclear industry, and to make a sizable intellectual contribution to the innovation-driven development of the global nuclear sphere. Third, it is necessary to steadily expand strategic interaction that contributes to the coordinated development of the global energy management system. In recent years, the efforts to ensure energy security and accessibility and to promote its sustainable development have been increasingly intertwined. There are unprecedented opportunities and challenges for all countries. In this regard, the parties must contribute to the formation of a more just, more balanced and accessible, as well as more open global energy management system, and offer a greater number of solutions to improve global energy management. Today, combating climate change is the common challenge for all countries. As responsible powers, China and Russia must broaden the understanding of these challenges, promote the implementation of even more ambitious projects for low-carbon cooperation similar to these four blocks, and play a constructive role in the implementation of the goals of global sustainable development. Thank you. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: President Xi Jinping, my dear friend, First of all, I am delighted to see you and to be able to attend this landmark event. Colleagues, I would like to join the President of China in congratulating you all on the beginning of construction of four power units at the Tianwan NPP and the Xudapu NPP. During this ceremony, President Xi and I will launch the concreting of the foundation of these power units. Russian and Chinese specialists are working on this flagship joint project which is truly a milestone. They are building powerful, modern Russian-designed nuclear reactors that meet all safety and environmental standards. It is planned that they will start operating as soon as in 2026–2028, which, as President Xi just said, will be a solid contribution to China’s energy security. Chinese consumers will have access to larger volumes of inexpensive and clean electric power. The Tianwan NPP, which will be expanded with new power units, was itself built with Russia’s participation and has been successfully operating since 2007. I am confident that the Russian reactors at the Xudapu NPP will operate as seamlessly and effectively. Rosatom is the company in charge of building nuclear power facilities in China in cooperation with its Chinese partners. Rosatom relies on the advanced practices and expertise of Russian scientists as well as Russia’s unique high technology capabilities in industrial production. I should note that strict sanitary measures are observed at all construction sites where Russian and Chinese nuclear power specialists are working, commensurate with the current epidemiological situation. All necessary measures are being taken to protect the health of both permanent workers and contractors. President Xi and I determined the main areas of our genuinely close partnership, the cooperation between Russia and China on nuclear technology, during my state visit to China in 2018. Cooperation in the area of peaceful nuclear development is an essential component of the entire scope of Russia−China strategic partnership, which is extensive, truly friendly and mutually beneficial. Very soon, we will be celebrating 20 years of our core bilateral document, the Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation. Since the signing of this treaty, Russia and China have achieved great success in strengthening our multidimensional cooperation and mutual trust across all areas without exception: politics, international affairs, trade and the economy, cultural and humanitarian exchanges. It can be said that Russia-China relations have reached their highest level in history. Returning to the topic of nuclear energy cooperation, I would like to note, with great satisfaction, that all the agreements reached at the highest level are being consistently and unfailingly fulfilled. In addition to the construction of new power units at the Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants, there are many other large Russian-Chinese initiatives that have been and are being implemented. These initiatives include an experimental fast neutron reactor built in China with Russia’s participation. It is possible that China will get involved in an international consortium that is building a multi-purpose fast neutron research reactor in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. Other plans include joint research concerning the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Russia also supplied China with radionuclide heating blocks for the spacecraft that was the first in history to land on the far side of the Moon in 2019. We were extremely happy about your success, dear Chinese friends. I am convinced that Russia and China will have many more ambitious and successful projects together. We are ready to develop our cooperation in the construction of nuclear power plants, and innovative partnership in the development and implementation of low-carbon and other technologies. This work will help our countries make a noticeable contribution to supplying global markets with clean energy, to implementing the international climate agenda and to ensuring consistent sustainable development in the world in general. Friends, In conclusion, I would like to extend my gratitude to President Xi for his personal dedication to our bilateral cooperation and wish great success to all our Russian and Chinese colleagues and friends. Thank you. <…> Published in sections: News, Transcripts Publication date: May 19, 2021, 12:35 Direct link: en.kremlin.ru/d/65606 Text version Official Website of the President of Russia: Launch of construction of new power units at Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/65606 Presidential Executive Office 2024
Gala New Year’s Eve event	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/62423	December 26, 2019, 19:30	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Vladimir Putin attended a gala New Year’s Eve event at the Bolshoi Theatre. Among the guests invited to attend the festive event were members of the Government, members of the State Duma and the Federation Council, heads of political parties and regional executive authorities, representatives of the judicial authorities, academics, athletes, cultural figures, the military, traditional faith leaders and the heads of major companies and civic organisations. The event programme featured one-act ballets, the Carmen Suite and Diamonds. The ballet Carmen Suite was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in 1967. Music was arranged by Rodion Shchedrin based on Georges Bizet’s famous opera. The part of Carmen was performed by Maia Plisetskaya. In 2005, the performance was resumed. The ballet Diamonds to Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s music is one of the three acts from the ballet Jewels by George Balanchine, which he first staged for the New York City Ballet Company in 1967. The premier performance of Jewels at the Bolshoi Theatre took place in 2012. * * * Russian President Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, friends, We have again met at the Bolshoi Theatre for a New Year’s Eve celebration. Last time we met here for New Year’s Eve and ahead of the Year of Theatre, and it seemed to me that many liked the way we met to celebrate New Year’s Eve. Clearly, all of you are busy and you do not have much time to visit the Bolshoi. Therefore, an opportunity like this seems to be a nice gift for each of us. Today, we look forward to the wonderful emotions that classical music always charges us with, all the more so as it will be performed by brilliant musicians at the country’s main theatre. Two of the best ballets in the world will be performed today on this famous stage: the captivating Carmen Suite and Diamonds by Balanchine. I am sure that the great music and choreography combined with friendly and informal communication will create a pleasant atmosphere for our meeting and put us in a good mood for New Year’s Eve. Hope is what always brings us together ahead of the New Year. We hope that the new year will be better than the previous one. We know that each year brings with it new achievements, new names and new discoveries and gives us new experience – professional and worldly. But what is invariable is our desire to work for the common good, for our Motherland, for the prosperity of our country, so people can live better in practice rather than in word. Of course, on the eve of the New Year, we review what has been done over the previous year, how the country lived in 2019 and what it has under its belt at the beginning of 2020. All this, all these results, are, to a large extent, results achieved by the people who have gathered here today. I would like to thank you for this. With all my heart, I wish you every success in 2020. I wish you health. Happy New Year.

Address to participants and guests of the 10th Moscow Conference on International Security	http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/69166	August 16, 2022, 10:05	All content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, Esteemed foreign guests, Let me welcome you to the anniversary 10th Moscow Conference on International Security. Over the past decade, your representative forum has become a significant venue for discussing the most pressing military-political problems. Today, such an open discussion is particularly pertinent. The situation in the world is changing dynamically and the outlines of a multipolar world order are taking shape. An increasing number of countries and peoples are choosing a path of free and sovereign development based on their own distinct identity, traditions and values. These objective processes are being opposed by the Western globalist elites, who provoke chaos, fanning long-standing and new conflicts and pursuing the so-called containment policy, which in fact amounts to the subversion of any alternative, sovereign development options. Thus, they are doing all they can to keep hold onto the hegemony and power that are slipping from their hands; they are attempting to retain countries and peoples in the grip of what is essentially a neocolonial order. Their hegemony means stagnation for the rest of the world and for the entire civilisation; it means obscurantism, cancellation of culture, and neoliberal totalitarianism. They are using all expedients. The United States and its vassals grossly interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states by staging provocations, organising coups, or inciting civil wars. By threats, blackmail, and pressure, they are trying to force independent states to submit to their will and follow rules that are alien to them. This is being done with just one aim in view, which is to preserve their domination, the centuries-old model that enables them to sponge on everything in the world. But a model of this sort can only be retained by force. This is why the collective West – the so-called collective West – is deliberately undermining the European security system and knocking together ever new military alliances. NATO is crawling east and building up its military infrastructure. Among other things, it is deploying missile defence systems and enhancing the strike capabilities of its offensive forces. This is hypocritically attributed to the need to strengthen security in Europe, but in fact quite the opposite is taking place. Moreover, the proposals on mutual security measures, which Russia put forward last December, were once again disregarded. They need conflicts to retain their hegemony. It is for this reason that they have destined the Ukrainian people to being used as cannon fodder. They have implemented the anti-Russia project and connived at the dissemination of the neo-Nazi ideology. They looked the other way when residents of Donbass were killed in their thousands and continued to pour weapons, including heavy weapons, for use by the Kiev regime, something that they persist in doing now. Under these circumstances, we have taken the decision to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine, a decision which is in full conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. It has been clearly spelled out that the aims of this operation are to ensure the security of Russia and its citizens and protect the residents of Donbass from genocide. The situation in Ukraine shows that the United States is attempting to draw out this conflict. It acts in the same way elsewhere, fomenting the conflict potential in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. As is common knowledge, the US has recently made another deliberate attempt to fuel the flames and stir up trouble in the Asia-Pacific. The US escapade towards Taiwan is not just a voyage by an irresponsible politician, but part of the purpose-oriented and deliberate US strategy designed to destabilise the situation and sow chaos in the region and the world. It is a brazen demonstration of disrespect for other countries and their own international commitments. We regard this as a thoroughly planned provocation. It is clear that by taking these actions the Western globalist elites are attempting, among other things, to divert the attention of their own citizens from pressing socioeconomic problems, such as plummeting living standards, unemployment, poverty, and deindustrialisation. They want to shift the blame for their own failures to other countries, namely Russia and China, which are defending their point of view and designing a sovereign development policy without submitting to the diktat of the supranational elites. We also see that the collective West is striving to expand its bloc-based system to the Asia-Pacific region, like it did with NATO in Europe. To this end, they are creating aggressive military-political unions such as AUKUS and others. It is obvious that it is only possible to reduce tensions in the world, overcome military-political threats and risks, improve trust between countries and ensure their sustainable development through a radical strengthening of the contemporary system of a multipolar world. I reiterate that the era of the unipolar world is becoming a thing of the past. No matter how strongly the beneficiaries of the current globalist model cling to the familiar state of affairs, it is doomed. The historic geopolitical changes are going in a totally different direction. And, of course, your conference is another important proof of the objective processes forming a multipolar world, bringing together representatives from many countries who want to discuss security issues on an equal footing, and conduct a dialogue that takes into account the interests of all parties, without exception. I want to emphasise that the multipolar world, based on international law and more just relations, opens up new opportunities for counteracting common threats, such as regional conflicts and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and cybercrime. All these challenges are global, and therefore it would be impossible to overcome them without combining the efforts and potentials of all states. As before, Russia will actively and assertively participate in such coordinated joint efforts; together with its allies, partners and fellow thinkers, it will improve the existing mechanisms of international security and create new ones, as well as consistently strengthen the national armed forces and other security structures by providing them with advanced weapons and military equipment. Russia will secure its national interests, as well as the protection of its allies, and take other steps towards building of a more democratic world where the rights of all peoples and cultural and civilisational diversity are guaranteed. We need to restore respect for international law, for its fundamental norms and principles. And, of course, it is important to promote such universal and commonly acknowledged agencies as the United Nations and other international dialogue platforms. The UN Security Council and the General Assembly, as it was intended initially, are supposed to serve as effective tools to reduce international tensions and prevent conflicts, as well as facilitate the provision of reliable security and wellbeing of countries and peoples. In conclusion, I want to thank the conference organisers for their major preparatory work and I wish all participants substantial discussions. I am sure that the forum will continue to make a significant contribution to the strengthening of peace and stability on our planet and facilitate the development of constructive dialogue and partnership. Thank you for your attention.
