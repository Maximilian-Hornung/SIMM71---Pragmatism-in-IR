"Greetings on Defender of the Fatherland Day","http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/67839","February 23, 2022, 09:00","Vladimir Putin made a video address to congratulate veterans, the military and civilian personnel of the Armed Forces and all citizens of Russia on this holiday. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Comrade officers, veterans, Please accept my warmest greetings on this holiday, Defender of the Fatherland Day, which is celebrated all over the country not only by tradition but also by right. It embodies the feelings of respect our citizens feel for their noble defenders, our pride in all those who served and serve in the Army and the Navy, recognition of their heroic merits to the Fatherland to assert our national interests, sovereignty and independence. Patriotism and the unity of our nation, the exploits of its devoted sons and daughters have always been the foundation of the martial history of our thousand-year-old country, its glory and victories. We are proud of the many generations of its defenders: the guards of Alexander Nevsky and Dmitry Donskoy, the warriors of Minin and Pozharsky and the heroes of Poltava and Borodino, Stalingrad and the unstoppable assault on Berlin, all those who brought glory to our Fatherland according to the great traditions of our ancestors. On this day, we have sincere, heart-felt words of gratitude for the Great Patriotic War veterans. We will always remember that you, the valiant generation of victors, crushed Nazism and saved our country and the entire world from this barbaric, merciless force. Your feat is a summit of human history, a great example for all those who are serving today in the Army and the Navy, and protecting Russia from external threats on land, in air and at sea. Comrade officers, Ensuring that our country can defend itself remains a primary responsibility of government, and the Armed Forces serve as a reliable guarantee of our national security, the peaceful and orderly lives of our people and Russia’s stable and steady development. We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATO’s military activities. And yet, Russia’s appeals to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered. Our country is always open to a direct and honest dialogue and ready to search for diplomatic solutions to the most complicated issues. But I want to repeat that Russia’s interests and the security of our people are an indisputable priority. So, we will continue to strengthen and modernise our Army and Navy, striving to increase their effectiveness, so they are fitted out with the most cutting-edge equipment. We have done a lot over the previous years to carry out the quality modernisation of the Armed Forces. They have gained in mobility and acquired new combat experience. During the operation in Syria, they proved in practice that they are capable of accomplishing the most difficult tasks. The training and coordination of army units and formations have greatly improved. This is clearly shown by snap drills, manoeuvres and regular large-scale military exercises, including jointly with our allies, as well as responsible peacekeeping operations. We have weapons that are second to none in the world and they are operational. We will continue to develop promising weapon systems, including hypersonic weapons and those based on new physical principles, and expand the use of advanced digital technology and elements of artificial intelligence. Complexes like these are weapons of the future, which can boost the potential of our Armed Forces several-fold. At the same time, we understand that the most advanced equipment is operated by people. It is very important that they have the latest knowledge and excellent training; however, personal qualities of Russian soldiers, such as patriotism, endurance, selflessness and mutual assistance have always – at all times – been of utmost importance. The role of a commander in developing these features is indispensable. Our officers are not only the core of our Army and Navy – these people are sincerely devoted to Russia and their military duty. I thank you for your faithful and honest service to our Motherland, for the responsible training of personnel, for fulfilling your duties conscientiously and with ultimate dedication, and holding sacred the spirit and character of the national military school. Friends, As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I have confidence in you, Russian soldiers and officers, in your high professionalism, bravery and reliability, that you will guard the peace of our people, and stand up for the national interests of our great country. I wish you good health and every success in your service. I want to extend the best wishes to your families and friends. Again, my sincere greetings to you on this holiday!

"Plenary session of United Cultures Forum","http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/75091","September 12, 2024, 18:40","Vladimir Putin addressed the plenary session of the 10th St Petersburg International United Cultures Forum. The events of the 10th St Petersburg International United Cultures Forum will last until September 14. The anniversary year’s theme is the 21st Century Culture: Sovereignty or Globalism? The plenary session was held in the General Staff building of the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. * * * President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ladies and gentlemen, friends, I am glad to welcome you in Russia, in St Petersburg. It is the tenth time now that our northern capital city welcomes cultural representatives from around the world. Every meeting of this kind, like the culture itself, embodies the Zeitgeist and raises acute, vital and most important issues. The Forum of United Cultures is a substantive answer to the most complicated challenges that our countries and nations are facing today. Even its name recognises the civilisational diversity of the world, people’s natural right to identity, respect for traditional values and religions and, of course, the countries’ unconditional equality in shaping the global cultural agenda. These approaches and principles were envisaged in the Declaration adopted at the last year’s forum. Their relevance in our time is higher than ever. The importance of humanism and dialogue, mutual respect and trust in the world is shared by the global majority. However, it is unfortunately under constant pressure and the threat of dilution, primarily due to unprecedented politicisation of the cultural sphere, which is being turned into a weapon in geopolitical schemes, and due to constant attempts to push it to the sidelines and to belittle the importance of national value systems and everything that does not coincide with the agenda promoted by the globalist elites and the ruling circles in some countries. Russia has identified its main values and enshrined them in the Constitution, the country’s Basic law. We protect these values and everyone who shares them, who, like us, believes that the people’s right to speak their mother tongue and keep the faith of their fathers, to live in harmony with nature under its natural laws is sacred. Without exaggeration, the result of these efforts will determine both the future world order and prospects for culture. We believe that it should and can exist without gross interference and without cancel culture, that is, the cancellation of culture itself. There is a good reason that diplomacy is called an art. It takes more than knowledge and talent to master it. Diplomacy is also culture: a culture of actions, emotions, and speech. It is what gives an understanding of what can or cannot be said or done in order to avoid irreversible consequences. Culture has always been a kind of a fuse for the world. It seems to have melted through in some countries. Today, many high-ranking politicians have lost their moral boundaries, breaking taboos that remained even during the most tense moments of the Cold War. In countries where such elites rule, people start gradually to accept xenophobia and then extreme forms of discrimination and persecution on national, ethnic, or religious grounds as a matter of course. We all know how quickly the ruling regimes get dehumanised in situations like this, and what it means for particular families and people of different ages. We can see this. This is why I have recently signed a Presidential Executive Order on providing humanitarian support to people who share traditional Russian spiritual and moral values. We are not fighting against any other values ​​– we support our own. This is the difference in approaches between us and our opponents. This decision was made in response to the growing flow of requests from countries where people are essentially being deprived of freedom of choice, mainly families with children, against whom local authorities impose perverted ethical standards. There are also many requests from cultural figures who do not want to restrict their creativity to the Procrustean bed of quotas and criteria and to create in compliance with neoliberal standards alien to them. These standards are being actively spread in some media, thus forming what is called mainstream. If authors are interested in their work being published or released, they must follow this mainstream. If there is a shadow of dissent or doubt in these works or even in private statements, then the writer, director, or actor will be ostracised or cancelled. Moreover, we can see more often how the value agenda promoted by Western elites ignores and sometimes deliberately insults global religions and cultural traditions of entire regions of the world. I believe that most countries and peoples do not like this approach. They see the future of culture in mutual respect and trust, as well as in equal international cooperation in this area. In hosting this forum once again, especially during such challenging times, we remain deeply convinced of the essential need for dialogue between cultures. Your voices, friends, must be heard. No amount of aggressive propaganda can stand against genuine art, because true artists have an acute sense of the times and the needs of society. They can discern real from false values and recognise those who genuinely fight for peace, prosperity, and friendship among nations, as opposed to those who cloak self-interest, superiority, and destructive ambitions and their exceptionalism behind noble words. Your creative, scientific, and educational activity holds tremendous potential for fostering peace and countering division. It helps maintain bonds between people and has the power to heal the wounds inflicted by conflicts and wars. That is why it is so important for you to have opportunities to communicate, exchange ideas, and collaborate on joint projects. As one of the most diverse nations in the world, Russia is genuinely pleased to offer you this platform, including through today’s forum. We understand that the cornerstone of cultural development is continuous interaction and mutual enrichment. The unity of diverse cultures and traditions holds immense creative power. This unity shapes our national identity and embodies core national values such as mutual support, justice, compassion, historical memory, continuity of generations, strong family bonds, patriotism, and civic duty. For our international audience it is important to emphasise that Russia emerged as a multinational state from the very beginning. This rich diversity is deeply ingrained in our traditions and forms the foundation of both our shared identity and spiritual strength. We place great emphasis on cultural development. Museums, theatres, community centres, and libraries are constantly being modernised, and places of worship are being restored. Public spaces like embankments, parks, and public gardens are also being revitalised. This effort not only enhances the cultural landscape but also plays a crucial role in the development of all our regions. During my recent visit to Tuva, I observed the growth of the local religious community. Across the country, we are building hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of new mosques, churches, and synagogues. This cultural and religious revival is progressing rapidly, in ways that were unprecedented in both Tsarist and Soviet Russia. We are making significant efforts to protect cultural heritage sites and are planning to adopt a long-term programme that will be implemented not only through government funding but also with the support of private benefactors. We have experience in this area and plan to build on it. We recognise the importance of restoring historic estates and churches, as they are tangible representations of our centuries-old history and national identity. Cultural and humanitarian ties, cooperation in art and education, and youth exchanges are key priorities of Russia’s BRICS chairmanship. This organisation represents a model for a multipolar world, where principles such as mutual respect, independent development paths, and practical implementation of the UN Charter’s key principle, sovereign equality among states, prevail. This year, Russia also holds the Commonwealth of Independent States chairmanship. Both through the CIS and BRICS, an unprecedented number of projects are being implemented. The business agenda of your forum includes meetings within the framework of these organisations. Just yesterday, for instance, as far as I know, a meeting of the culture ministers from participating countries took place. I’m pleased to welcome you all here – colleagues, ladies, and gentlemen – and to thank you for your contribution to strengthening inter-culture dialogue, for your dedication to infusing it with vibrant, creative content and innovative ideas. I believe the time has come to establish a new, shared international infrastructure for national cultures. In today’s world, the most successful societies are those where people are driven and inspired by culture, and where they can rely on a strong foundation of their values, history, and traditions. Friends, colleagues, Last year, we had in-depth discussions on many issues of shared interest. I hope you will understand that, unfortunately, I will not be able to engage in such discussions right now. However, I am confident that everything taking place at the forum and across the various platforms organised by the participants has been both highly engaging and valuable. We are always pleased to welcome you to Russia – not just at this forum, but also at many events Russia hosts across various areas related to both our culture and the global culture, which our nation’s culture is an integral part of. Thank you for your attention, and I wish you all the very best. Thank you very much.

"Patriarch Kirill awarded Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First-Called","http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/67150","November 20, 2021, 12:30","Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia was decorated with the highest state award of the Russian Federation, the Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First-Called in a ceremony held in St Catherine’s Hall of the Moscow Kremlin. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Your Holiness, Allow me to sincerely greet you on your 75th birthday. You have chosen the path of spiritual and moral service and you are pursuing it with dignity, wisdom and deep understanding of the responsibility for the destiny of our people and Russia. Obviously, the Church has been through both good and hard times, but currently its voice has acquired momentous significance again; it is being heeded and trusted. To a great degree this is the result of your personal efforts and relentless pastoral labour, sincere care about infusing the ideals of peace, justice, love and mutual understanding into people’s hearts. Under your thoughtful spiritual guidance, the Church is actively participating in the life of society, in resolving current social issues and in implementing large-scale projects, which matter for the entire country. Your fruitful pastoral service has garnered you the highest regard not only in Russia but also abroad, as well as respect among millions of believers in our vast country. I also want to note your immense contribution to promoting the traditional values of our peoples and to the preservation of our historical and cultural heritage. Today, as we fight the coronavirus pandemic, your call to unite in the face of the threat inspires the Russian Orthodox clergy, volunteers and all those who carry out the merciful mission of helping the sick, those in need of support and a spiritual pillar. Your Holiness, it is a great and tremendous honour for me to commend your merits and work for the good of our Motherland and to decorate you with Russia’s top award – the Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First-Called, a particularly revered educator and missionary of the Christian faith. One again, I congratulate you on your birthday. I wish you good health and success in your noble service. Patriarch Kirill Kirill Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia : Your Excellency, Mr President, I wholeheartedly thank you for your kind words about my humble contribution, and, of course, for this order, Russia’s highest award. The Order of St Andrew the First-Called is a state award but it is no coincidence that it was instituted in honour of Apostle Andrew. He was one of the twelve apostles who shed the light of Christ’s truth onto the land which is today a significant part of Russia. In this respect the order in a certain sense is not only a token of state recognition but also a sacred object for it bears the image of St Andrew the First-Called. Given that the Order of Andrew the First-Called, the enlightener of our land, is the highest order in contemporary Russia, I would like to speak about the changes in the life of our people and the changes in the people themselves. We all know that “there is no man that sinneth not,” according to a church maxim. And there is nobody who lives their lives without making mistakes. There are also collective mistakes, and we know that there were such mistakes in the history of our country and our people. At the end of the 20th and the turn of the 21st century our life – the life of the state, society as well personal lives of a great multitude of people – took on an amazing configuration in that we realise that we live in a happy country. Even though there are problems and we all are well aware of them, we have the key: we are free, we are independent, we have preserved our culture, we have preserved our faith. Our people have survived despite the hardest tribulations of the 20th century. Today, Russia is marching forward along its historic path with a large reserve of strength, and it is you who leads our Fatherland in this special period of our history. Thank you for the award and I would also like to express gratitude to you on behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church and on my own behalf for your unfading attention to spiritual life, for your balancing of politics and morals, for your commitment to building the life of our Fatherland based not only on law, but also on the truth. We are grateful for that. I know that a huge number of the sons and daughters of the Russian Orthodox Church wholeheartedly support my words today. Thank you once again for the high award. Allow me to wish you good health, God’s help, many years of life and success in further governing the Russian state. Vladimir Putin: You Holiness, thank you very much. To conclude this ceremony, which could be called modest even though it is a grand event, but it is modest because we all have to live under certain restrictions due to the pandemic, as I have said, but which is, nonetheless, a ceremony marking a great occasion, this is what I would like to say in conclusion. We are certainly well aware that the state’s achievements in the economy lie at the foundation of the country’s wellbeing, its economic progress and strengthening its defence capabilities. This is a basic matter which defies any arguments. Yet there are deeper issues. Both the economy and everything related to it depend on the spiritual underpinnings of any society that unify this society into a single whole. And society and the state only succeed when they unite into that whole. Your Holiness, you are the person who is attending to the core – our faith, our spiritual values, our basic principles, and you truly do it from the bottom of your heart with full dedication. I once again express my genuine gratitude and wish you all the very best. My congratulations. Patriarch Kirill: Thank you.

"Press statements following Russian-Turkish talks","http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/62948","March 5, 2020, 20:15","Upon the completion of the Russian-Turkish talks, which lasted about six hours, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan made statements for the press. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Today we held our third meeting this year. Our close personal contact allows us to promptly resolve various issues of bilateral cooperation and develop common approaches to settling key international problems. Today we discussed the serious situation that has taken shape in Idlib Province in Syria. Since the beginning of the year, the criminal gangs operating there have sharply stepped up their activities. They have regularly shelled both Syrian government troop positions and civilian residential areas. The radicals have continued to attack the Khmeimim Russian air base. Another attempt to hit it with a multiple launch rocket was made on March 1. In all, the Khmeimim air base has been attacked 15 times since the beginning of the year. Each time, we informed our Turkish partners about it in real time. The militants have actually managed to provoke the resumption of hostilities. Regrettably, there have been losses among the Turkish military as well. In this respect, I again expressed my condolences to Mr President, knowing that he feels these losses very deeply, to the families of the dead and to all Turkish people. We do not always agree with our Turkish partners when evaluating what is happening in Syria, but to this day, in each critical moment, we have managed to find points of contact on emerging disputed issues and reach mutually acceptable solutions by relying on the high level of bilateral relations. It happened this time as well. Today, we reaffirmed the interest of our countries in continuing our cooperation in the Astana format as well. It was the Astana process that provided a serious impetus for a settlement in Syria at one point. Our meeting today was preceded by a lot of work and several rounds of intensive consultations between inter-departmental delegations with an emphasis on the crisis situation in the Idlib zone. We proceed from the need to observe the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity in Syria. We are also convinced that the struggle against international terrorism must not be let up. Following our talks, we agreed on a common document, the provisions of which will be made public by our foreign ministers. This document describes the solutions that the President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Erdogan, and I elaborated during today’s consultations, which lasted over six hours. I would like to express hope that these agreements will create a solid foundation for the cessation of hostilities in the Idlib de-escalation zone, stop the suffering of civilians, put an end to the expansion of the humanitarian crisis and create conditions for the continuation of the peace process in the Syrian Arab Republic between all conflicting parties. I would also like to thank Mr President for coming to Moscow today, confirming the level of our relations. I would like to thank all of our Turkish colleagues for their intensive and difficult but constructive work that, in my opinion, produced positive results. Thank you for your attention. President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan Erdogan Recep TayyipPresident of Türkiye (retranslated): I am also very grateful. Mr President, Ministers, Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to greet you cordially and express my respect for you. First, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Putin for his kind invitation. At a time when tensions are still running high in our region, I am pleased to meet with Mr Putin again. During today’s meeting, we discussed issues related to Syria in detail, as well as the latest developments in Idlib. We can say – Mr Putin also said this – that we have worked on these issues for about six hours. In this respect, I would like to note that we had a sincere dialogue, and we discussed these relevant issues with Mr President. I can say, and you know this, that relations between Turkey and Russia are deeply rooted in history, spanning over five centuries. Of course, our countries and our people in both countries maintain very strong traditions and cooperation. Our strongest wish is that we continue to cooperate on the basis of mutual respect. This year we are celebrating the centenary of our diplomatic relations. We have invited Mr Putin to our country on this occasion. Ladies and gentlemen, As you know, in September 2018 Mr Putin and I adopted the Sochi Memorandum of Understanding that made it possible to reach relative stability in Idlib. It reads that tensions in Idlib will be reduced, any attacks in the region prevented, and existing status quo maintained. But starting in March attacks by the regime have become more frequent, which led to casualties among civilians and violated the Idlib agreement. First, I would like to say that primary responsibility for this rests with the forces of the regime, which breached this agreement. This region is home to four million people. We believe it is unacceptable to call 4 million residents terrorists and subject them to bombings. People, refugees leaving their homes because of the regime’s tough position – according to the UN there are about 1.5 million of them – are now near our borders. The main goal of the regime in Idlib is to ravage this region and put Turkey into a difficult position, facing a new wave of refugees. No doubt, Turkey will not stand idle in the face of such a threat. We have established observation posts in Idlib to reduce tensions in the region. They pledged to merely monitor the ceasefire but not control the territory. Some time ago we reached an agreement with Russia to send reinforcement to stabilise the region – to curb certain groups from continuing their attacks and to deter attacks by the regime. We are taking an active part in this. In this process, we tried to do all we could to coordinate our actions with Russian agencies and military. The regime’s attacks led to sad events and in this context it is necessary to establish a new status in Idlib. Today, in Moscow, together with our Russian colleagues, we discussed cooperation between our countries in detail. This cooperation was a contributing factor in resolving this issue. We have agreed to expand our relations to address political issues and the issues relating to the eastern bank of the Euphrates. We believe the regime’s forces will not be able to hurt our relations with Russia. Today at the negotiating table we decided to discuss this issue and show that we have the will to resolve it. First of all, I would like to note that we will declare a ceasefire as soon as possible and then we will coordinate our next steps. Today, at midnight March 5, a ceasefire will be put in place. All the necessary steps will be taken to ensure a sustainable ceasefire. Our objective is to avoid any further exacerbation of the humanitarian situation in this region. We will spare no effort to provide the necessary assistance to everyone in Syria who needs it. We will also make it easier for the refugees who fled the area as a result of these attacks to return home. In a little while, the foreign ministers of our two countries will make a statement that we have agreed on. In this process, Turkey reserves the right to use force to respond to any attack by the regime. Throughout this process, I will be in contact with my close friend; we will continue to maintain contact, as will the relevant bodies of our countries. Regarding the Syrian crisis, we will continue to work based on the principle of Syria’s territorial integrity as well as political unity to resolve this issue, I mean the Sochi agreements. I believe that the only key to resolving this issue is to ensure lasting peace and stability within the framework of the Geneva negotiating process. I would like to greet everyone, and I believe that we will benefit from all of our meetings.

"Gazprom's 30th anniversary","http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/speeches/70529","February 17, 2023, 14:00","Vladimir Putin took part, via videoconference, in an event marking Gazprom's 30th anniversary. President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues, good afternoon. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller Miller AlexeiGazprom CEO : Good afternoon, Mr President. Vladimir Putin: Hello. Not too cold, Mr Miller? Alexei Miller: No, everything is fine. Vladimir Putin: Is it cold where you are? What is the temperature? Alexei Miller: About minus 5 degrees Celsius, but the wind is blowing from the gulf. Vladimir Putin: I see. Today, we are marking the 30th anniversary of Gazprom, a world-famous Russian company. It is one of Russia’s largest and most advanced corporations, as well as a global leader in terms of natural gas reserves, output, and supplies. I am glad to convey to you my best wishes on this anniversary and congratulate all Gazprom staff members, who are almost half a million-strong (over 490,000): workers, engineers, geologists, drillers, construction workers, and people representing dozens of other crafts and trades. They are all top professionals, and the whole country is proud of you. Of course, today we must send our warmest greetings and best wishes to the Russian gas industry veterans. They were the ones who laid the foundations and started developing vast and unique deposits, built entire cities and towns, and laid energy supply routes of international significance. Gazprom was incorporated as an independent company in the early 1990s, which was a difficult period for the country, and the decision to preserve it as a single and integrated whole turned out to be strategically correct. Gazprom began to grow and has been a trailblazer for other industries and entire regions with their social infrastructure ever since, promoting Russia's economic revival and growth. Today, Gazprom remains a responsible, efficient and sustainable business. Despite the frankly unfair competition and direct attempts to halt and curb its development from the outside, Gazprom is moving forward and launching new projects, including by carrying out geological prospecting surveys, producing gas and ensuring its advanced processing, as well as taking part in building the Northern Latitudinal Railway and other transport infrastructure facilities. I must also note that Gazprom creates orders for Russian high-tech businesses, including SMEs and young researchers’ teams. Of course, Gazprom has a solid track record of paying special attention to carrying out major social and humanitarian projects by supporting cultural, educational and environmental programmes, building housing and schools, helping equip hospitals and improve and develop streets, embankments and parks. For example, over 2,000 sports centres, sports grounds and school stadiums have been built across Russia as part of the Gazprom for Children programme, which I believe was launched around 2007 (Mr Miller will correct me if I am wrong). Gazprom is investing substantial funds in the comprehensive development of our cities, rural areas and regions, and it is doing the right thing. I would like to thank its management, shareholders and all workers for that. It is notable that Gazprom’s perspective plans always look ahead and are designed for years and even decades to come, clearly, because of the long implementation cycle of your projects, which fully meets our national interests, and the goals and priorities of Russia as a major power and a sovereign centre of the multipolar world. Gazprom's specific goals and new projects are based on detailed expert analysis and projected changes and trends in global markets. According to those forecasts and opinions, natural gas will remain an extremely valuable natural resource, a true asset it has been for years, and the demand for it will only grow. Over the past 30 years, global natural gas consumption has almost doubled; in the next 20 years, according to expert estimates, it will add at least another 20 percent, and maybe more. In the so-called transition period, the demand will be enormous. Moreover, the Asia-Pacific region will account for more than half of projected growth, primarily the People’s Republic of China, given the high pace of its economic growth. In this context, the further development of the huge gas industry network created in the east of our country is becoming strategically important for Russia. This network includes the Yakutia and Irkutsk gas production centres, the Amur Gas Processing Plant, which is under construction, and the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, which was connected to new reserves with the launch of the Kovykta gas condensate field into commercial operation last December. Overall, as far as international cooperation and export contracts are concerned, Gazprom is facing monumental challenges, having to rearrange its logistics routes and gain a foothold in new markets. Yesterday alone, I think Mr Miller and I spent about two hours discussing all these plans with our potential partners. Let me emphasise that no matter how important international trade is, what matters the most to us is promoting our national development, providing for reliable, steady economic growth, shielding the national economy from any threats, and ensuring uninterrupted supplies for our enterprises and regions. Of course, this also includes improving the quality of life for people across all regions of Russia. I believe the expanded programme of social gasification, when connection to gas distribution networks is brought right up to the land plot boundary, is one of the most important projects for Gazprom in terms of its social responsibility. Starting this year, the programme has no expiration date. In addition, it now covers social infrastructure, educational and medical institutions, as well as housing. Let me remind you that certain categories of people can benefit from additional support. This includes families with many children and combat veterans. I am referring to subsidies people can obtain when buying services and gas equipment for their homes. We have already allocated federal funding to this effect, and I am asking you to always keep a close eye on these efforts. We planned several link-ups for this event with Gazprom sites across the country, from the Baltic Sea to Russia’s Far East. But before that, I would like to once again congratulate Gazprom workers on the company’s anniversary and thank you for your great work for the benefit of our people and our vast country and wish you every success in your undertakings. I will now pass the floor to Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller. Mr Miller, go ahead, please. Alexei Miller: Mr President, We are in the Lakhta Centre in St Petersburg. Gazprom headquarters is located in the Lakhta Centre, from which we manage the unified gas supply system in Russia, from Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka to Kaliningrad, across all time zones. During the autumn and winter seasons, when it is especially, intensely cold, Gazprom reliably and stably provides gas to its customers in the power sector, in industry and to the people, of course. Gazprom is implementing unique projects, which constitute the backbone of Russia’s gas sector in the 21st century. Today, Gazprom is a leader in the global energy market and the largest company in the country ensuring comprehensive power supply in Central Russia and providing not only gas but also electricity and heating to our customers. We have unrivalled expertise in working in the Arctic, unique competencies, experience and knowledge. Gazprom has created a new gas production centre on the Yamal Peninsula. We are developing new large hydrocarbon fields. I can tell you, with good reason, that Russia is doing more in the Arctic than anyone else. We have no rivals in the Arctic. We are also working successfully in the East. Mr President, you recently launched the Kovykta gas condensate field and the second phase of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline into commercial operation. The pipeline is now operational throughout its entire length, which is about 3,000 kilometres. The Kovykta and Chayanda fields, the largest in Eastern Siberia, are multi-component fields, which is why we are building the Amur Gas Processing Plant to supply products to the gas chemical industry. Gazprom is developing main transport in all regions of the country. At present, we are preparing to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, the Soyuz Vostok gas trunkline via Mongolia, the Far Eastern gas pipeline and, of course, a link to connect our gas transport network in the European part of Russia to the gas transport systems we have created under the Eastern Gas Programme. The main pipeline transport is the backbone of the further development of the gas supply and connection system. Providing gas supply in rural areas means, first of all, higher quality of life there, while higher rate of gas infrastructure development in the regions creates new opportunities for agriculture and industry. We can assure our customers that there is enough gas in Russia for decades to come. This conviction is based on the world’s largest resource portfolio. The flagship of production is the Yamal gas production centre and its heart is the Bovanenkovskoye field. We will give the floor to Bovanenkovo. General Director of Gazprom Dobycha Nadym Dmitry Shchegolev: Mr President, Mr Miller, I am at the Bovanenkovo oil and gas condensate deposit on the Yamal Peninsula. We began extraction here in 2012. Since then, we have put three gas fields into service and have reached design capacity. Now we can produce over 100 billion cubic metres of gas a year. We are increasing the number of gas production wells every year and now 595 out of 770 project wells are operating. Simultaneously, with the upgrades at Bovanenkovo, we are preparing to launch the operations at the Kharasaveyskoye deposit, which is a little over 100 kilometres to the northwest of here. Today, 100 natural gas wells out of the 167 project wells have been drilled. Construction is underway on a gas treatment plant, a booster compressor station and the Kharasavey-Borovenkovo connecting gas pipeline. We are planning to start industrial gas production at Kharasavey in 2024, which will add another 32 billion cubic metres of gas annually to Gazprom’s balance sheet. Today, about 3,000 Gazprom employees are working at Borovenkovo. Another thousand will work in shifts at the Kharasaveyskoye deposit. Climate conditions are severe, but we try to make up for this by creating good living conditions for our employees. They have a modern shift complex, gyms, cafeterias, a swimming pool and a concert hall. Gazprom’s 30th anniversary is an important event for our team. Working at Gazprom is an honourable and responsible profession. We are confident that the company has a great and glorious future. Alexei Miller: Mr President, Gas from Bovanenkovo is sent to the Vyborg area where Gazprom has built a gas liquefication plant. We are developing our own competences in liquefication technology and gaining our own experience. I am giving the floor to the team at Gazprom SPG Portovaya. General Director of Gazprom SPG Portovaya Anton Stukov: We are at the LNG production, storage and shipping facility. The company is located on the northeast coast of the Gulf of Finland. Our plant can produce 1.5 million tonnes of LNG per year. The complex was launched in September last year. By now it has already produced over half a million tonnes of LNG. The plant is connected to Russia’s unified gas distribution system. The gas is first processed at the plant and is then sent to the liquefication station. Two shops with Ladoga gas turbines compress the refrigerant. The temperature of LNG is about minus 160C. It is used by the public transport system in St Petersburg. We use a floating depot – the Portovy tank vessel – which can tranship LNG to gas-carrier vessels. Our main goal here is to ensure independent and autonomous natural gas supply to Kaliningrad. Mr President, you set this goal for us, and it has been successfully carried out. Colleagues, each of us wants to work with maximum dedication and full responsibility. Like thousands of Gazprom employees, we are doing all we can to ensure national energy security. Alexei Miller: Mr President, An unparalleled natural gas complex, which includes production, transport and processing facilities, has been created in Eastern Siberia. These facilities are connected by an unmatched and the world’s most modern, gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia. With that, I turn it over to Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk company. Director General of Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk Vladislav Borodin: We are at the Atamanskaya compressor station of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. I have workers, engineers and executives here who are making sure the gas pipeline operates reliably. The Power of Siberia has been under construction since 2014 in these extreme natural and climatic conditions. The pipes were laid through mountainous and seismic zones, permafrost and rocky soils. Today, the Power of Siberia offers new opportunities for gas infrastructure development in eastern Russia for decades ahead. Natural gas is now being supplied to boiler houses and production facilities, including the Vostochny Cosmodrome. We plan to ramp up the gas pipeline’s export capacity as well. To do so, second shops at seven compressor stations will be put into operation. They have been named after the trailblazers who came to Siberia in the 17th century. The capacity of the eighth station, Atamanskaya CU where we are now, will have almost doubled by the end of this year from 128 to 224 megawatts. Our company is working for the good of the country, and our success is the success of every Russian citizen. Together, we are a powerful force. We are the Power of Siberia, the power of Gazprom, and the power of Russia. Alexei Miller: Mr President, Eastern Siberia has multicomponent gas, which is why Gazprom is building gas processing facilities in this region in order to supply processed products to other high-tech industries. I turn the floor over to the Amur Gas Processing Plant. Director General of Gazprom Pererabotka Blagoveshchensk Yury Lebedev: After reaching full capacity, the Amur GPP will process 42 billion cubic metres of gas per year. Our plant is the basis for forming a large gas chemical cluster in the Amur Region. The Amur GPP products – ethane, propane, butane and pentane-hexane – will be used to make polyethylene, polypropylene, various plastics, construction materials, motor fuels and other products that are widely used in our country’s economy and abroad. Helium is a rare gas that our plant will produce in large quantities. It is used by high-tech industries, such as instrument making, aerospace, electronics and medicine. A gas chemical complex is being built next to the plant, which is technologically and infrastructurally connected with our enterprise. The best specialists from all over the country are moving to the town of Svobodny to build and then operate the Amur GPP. A workforce with unique competencies is being formed here. Our plant is a modern automated production facility as well. Our company has 2,500 employees that operate the plant. At full capacity, the team will include 3,200 specialists. The experience and knowledge that workers and engineers gain here will make it possible to expand the processing industry and to introduce the latest technology which will reliably provide Russia with gas and gas products in the 21st century. Alexander Miller: Mr President, Undoubtedly, Gazprom’s main social programme is further developing gas infrastructure and increasing the number of buildings connected to it. Without doubt, providing gas supply in rural areas means a new quality of life, while expanding gas supply and further developing gas infrastructure in the regions means creating new opportunities for the development of agriculture and industry in these regions. Next we will hear from the Tula Region. General Director of Gazprom Mezhregiongaz Sergei Gustov: Good afternoon, Mr President, Mr Miller, colleagues, Today Gazprom is implementing a gas supply and gas infrastructure development programme in 72 Russian regions. By 2025, gas will again come to 4,500 cities, towns and villages in our country. The programme is being implemented in full. In line with your instruction, Mr President, the end of 2021 in Russia saw the start of construction of gas pipelines at the expense of Gazprom up to applicants’ land plot boundary. In 2022 alone, we provided gas to 504,000 households. And this is a programme that has material, technical and financial resources. Everything that is necessary for gas supply and grid connection is produced in our country in sufficient quantity and of excellent quality. Thank you, Mr President, for your attention and support of this large-scale programme implemented by Gazprom. Gazprom, the United Russia party, the Russian Government, the Federation Council and the State Duma are working together to complete the task before us. New households are getting access to gas supply, as well as industrial, farming, and social facilities. Today Tula Region Governor Alexei Dyumin and I will open a new pipeline that will provide gas to 300 households, which means that people will feel comfortable, cosy and warm, and save on heating. The most important thing is to fulfil the task that you have set, Mr President: to expand gas access in the country to the full extent technically possible. I congratulate you, colleagues, on the 30th anniversary of our company. And now I give the floor to Tula Region Governor Alexei Dyumin. Governor of the Tula Region Alexei Dyumin Dyumin AlexeiAide to the President : Good afternoon, Mr President, Mr Miller, Allow me to join the greetings and congratulate the management and industry personnel on this anniversary, and to thank you for working hard to supply gas to our region. This provides completely new opportunities for resolving problems and developing the region in various areas, but the most important and key thing, our priority is our peoples’ comfort. In August 2020, in the Hero City of Tula, Mr Miller and I signed a programme for the further gas infrastructure development in our region through to 2025, which provides for connecting 363 towns in our region to gas grids. In line with your instruction on social gasification – this is fully underway in the region, this programme is in demand and appreciated by residents: 7,000 contracts have already been signed, gas connection has been brought up to the boundaries of 3,500 land plots and households. Also, under this programme, we plan to supply gas to another 17,000 households. Mr President, in line with your instructions, we have also developed and are implementing regional support for 13 categories of persons entitled to benefits – subsidies that amount to 120,000 rubles each. Separately, I would like to stop and once again thank Mr Miller personally, as well as the entire management of the company for their active – you spoke about this, Mr President – participation in the social life of our region. In the past seven years, Gazprom has built two sports and recreation complexes and 67 multifunctional sports grounds in the Tula Region, where residents enjoy spending time, both in summer and in winter. A large ice palace opened, which gave a boost to the development of ice hockey in our region, and there are already two youth teams and a VHL team that has had good results. In addition, the construction of a multifunctional indoor track continues, which, after opening, will host competitions at the highest level, both national and international. Mr President, everything that has already been implemented, and the plans and goals that we face, which we will implement, would not be possible without your personal participation and without the instructions that you have given. Thank you very much, personally, for your attention to this area, Mr Miller for your participation in the development of our region. Mr Miller, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that today I have signed an appeal addressed to you with an additional request for the construction of multifunctional sports grounds, which the residents in remote towns and municipalities are waiting for. I am sure that on this festive day – Gazprom: Dreams Come True! – the decision will be positive, and in the near future we will already see positive results. Once again, I congratulate your staff and all the management on this anniversary. Mr President, thank you very much. This concludes my report. Alexey Miller: Mr President, Traditionally, when gas comes to a town, we ignite the ceremonial control torch. I ask you to give permission to ignite the control torch. Vladimir Putin: Please, yes, of course. (Ceremonial ignition of a gas torch in the village of Kresty, Tula Region, now with a gas connection.) Alexei Miller: Mr President, Gazprom is a socially responsible company, and, as you noted, we have been implementing the Gazprom for Children programme since 2007. Over 2,000 sports facilities have been built in 74 regions of the Russian Federation, of which 202 are sports and recreation centres. A month ago we opened the Academy of Martial Arts in Sochi. I’ll now pass the floor to Sirius. Gazprom Management Board member Yelena Mikhailova: Last year, 70 different facilities were opened as part of the Gazprom for Children project: 19 sports and recreation centres and 46 plate structures were built, five facilities were upgraded. A breakthrough was made in the Far Eastern Federal District, with seven sports and recreation centres built and one upgraded. Today we are at the new Academy of Martial Arts, which will become home to athletes practising judo and sambo, from kids to Russia’s national teams and our famous Olympic champions. This is a big, modern world-class sports centre with an area of ​​63,500 square metres. It was built according to the highest standards in record time – 30 months. Our unique centre has two training halls, a hotel for athletes, a hydrothermal complex with a swimming pool, and a medical rehabilitation centre. Also in Olympic Park, we refurbished the Ice Cube and built a sports centre for hosting competitions, which has a unique hall with stands, rooms for athletes and referee teams, and a media centre. We wish our athletes success and new great victories. Together we are building a healthy future for our nation. Hurray! I am giving the floor to President of the Russian Judo Federation Sergei Soloveichik. President of the Russian Judo Federation Sergei Soloveichik: On behalf of the Russian judo family, I would like to thank you, Mr President, the Government of the Russian Federation, Gazprom, and the leadership of the Sirius federal territory for this gift we need so much. We have always dreamed of our own home, and thanks to your support, the first training session will take place today on the tatami of the Academy of Martial Arts. At the Academy of Martial Arts, the best Russian judokas will improve their skills in order to perform well at the world’s major competitions. Along with the training of national teams, the new academy will hone our priority programmes, Preschool Judo, School Judo, and Family Judo, which we developed together with specialists from the Ministry of Education and the Sirius federal territory. Thanks to these programmes, hundreds of thousands of children in our country will receive physical, spiritual and, most importantly, patriotic education on the tatami, and will become upstanding citizens of Russia. Thank you. Alexei Miller: Mr President, The Lakhta Centre provides extensive space for hosting sites of the Gazprom for Children programme. These are sites for creative, sports, and intellectual development. A state-of-the-art planetarium and a large educational and leisure centre for children and youngsters, where they can gain new knowledge and new skills, will be opened at the Lakhta Centre. Without a doubt, the Gazprom for Children programme is a great contribution to the future of Russia. Colleagues, Congratulations on the 30th anniversary of Gazprom. And, as we say at Gazprom, “and now back to work!” Vladimir Putin: Mr Miller, colleagues, friends, We have just mentioned some facilities that Gazprom has built or is already operating, implementing them in part and drafting its development plans in general. However, this is far from all that Gazprom has and what it is doing. This is simply a small sample of its activities. But even if we return to what our colleagues were talking about now, the Bovanenkovo and Kharasavey fields, we will recall that the first one has 4.9 trillion – almost 5 trillion cubic metres of proven reserves. The corresponding figure for the second one is about 2 trillion cubic metres. These are astronomical reserves for any country. I won’t even mention at this point Grazprom’s other capacities that are simply incommensurable with any other gas-producing country in the world. These are tremendous reserves. Let’s look at the LNG plant with a project capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of LNG per year. Here’s something I noted during the report made on this facility. It has the Ladoga compressor station of domestic make. We know that in the past the company depended on foreign producers in this area of its work. Partly this dependence still remains to this day. Gazprom is a contractor for our power engineering companies. Considering our competences and education of our engineers and scientists, orders by Gazprom – the anchor contractor that will be joined by others – will promote the development of domestic power engineering. Gazprom is also playing an important role in this respect. This is just one of the areas in which we are seeing the synergy of Gazprom’s work with related companies. I mentioned related companies but synergy also exists in other areas. Our colleague reported about the Atamanskaya compressor station in the Amur Region and mentioned in passing gas supplies to the Vostochny Cosmodrome. But listen – in one instance this is a large, important project for the county and in another, it is the development of the space industry. It would seem gas supplies don’t matter that much… But they drastically change the capacities of the Vostochny Cosmodrome, its civilian component. The economics of the entire enterprise, the cosmodrome, is undergoing a dramatic change, providing Russia with additional opportunities for developing its space industry as well. It is perfectly obvious that this is being done with Gazprom’s support in this case. Or take the Amur Gas Processing Plant. Of course, as one of the world’s largest gas producers, Gazprom should do and is doing this – it is gradually developing gas processing, gas-to-chemicals in this case. It is abundantly clear that this is the future, just like the processing of other energy resources, including oil and coal. And this is also a very important, serious area of Gazprom’s development. We have cited an example of Gazprom’s major national effort to develop gas infrastructure. We have heard some analysts and economists say that this is a low-margin project that will not generate much revenue for Gazprom. Nevertheless, I believe Gazprom is doing the right thing in developing these programmes because it creates a market for the future, and material progress – supplying gas to households is definitely beneficial for the well-being of Russian families – growth of the material well-being creates future consumers in many aspects. In this regard, I would like to mention supplying the Russian economy with natural gas motor fuel for transport, households, and passenger vehicles, which is important, and I want you – the leaders of the regions will certainly hear us – to focus on this. By the same token, social programmes such as Gazprom for Children, Gazprom is running quite a few of them in Russia, serve the same purpose of strengthening the future market. Developing the public health and fitness, and recreation sector, is all about working for our people and your current and future consumers. In addition to socio-political, domestic political dimension, it clearly has an economic dimension. I would also like to thank you for the wrestling, judo and sambo facility which was most recently built under the Gazprom for Children programme. I am sure it was built to the highest standards. Mr Miller, we agreed some time ago that we would tour that facility in person. I can see that you are wearing your hat like Nightingale the Robber, which once again shows some of your personality. So, as agreed, let’s – even though you have never done any of these sports – let’s step on the tatami in this excellent facility together with the children who are practising there today and see how it works. As for the Lakhta Centre, the construction of which you spearheaded, I believe it will be put to good use by Gazprom and everyone who lives nearby, since Lakhta Centre has much to offer potential customers. This is a 462-metre high building, the tallest in Europe. I am sure Gazprom will remain at a similarly high position too. I wish you a happy anniversary and every success. Best wishes.
